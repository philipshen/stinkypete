# Quick Research: L3Harris Iver AUV Sales Figures

## Question
What are the exact L3Harris Iver total production/sales numbers?

## Findings

L3Harris has shipped **over 375 AUVs total** across the Iver product line, benefiting from 15+ years of production experience. This aligns with and slightly updates the "350+ units" figure cited in the commercial-scientific UMV research.

Key deployment confirmations:
- Selected for UK Royal Navy Project Wilton
- Selected for US Navy Next Generation Small-Class MEMUUV program
- Iver4 580 and Iver4 900 are current production models
- The company is actively establishing the "hybrid undersea fleet" concept (per July 2025 editorial)

L3Harris does not publicly break down sales by Iver3 vs. Iver4 variants or by customer segment (military vs. commercial).
