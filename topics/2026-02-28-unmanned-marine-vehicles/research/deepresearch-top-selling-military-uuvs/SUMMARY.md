# Summary: Top-Selling Military UUVs

## Abstract

The military UUV market is dominated by a handful of established platforms, with HII's REMUS series leading in unit volume (700+ sold to 30 countries) and Atlas Elektronik's SeaFox leading in expendable mine disposal. The market is valued at $4-6 billion in 2025 and projected to reach $8-10 billion by 2030, driven by the emergence of Extra-Large UUVs (XLUUVs) like Boeing's Orca and the shift toward standoff mine countermeasures systems that replace traditional manned minehunters with drone swarms.

## Key Insights

- **REMUS Series dominates unit sales**: Over 700 vehicles sold to 30 countries including 14 NATO members. The US Navy Lionfish program (REMUS 300) is worth up to $347 million for 200 vehicles. [Source: nasdaq.com, hii.com]
- **Atlas Elektronik SeaFox is the highest-volume expendable system**: Described as the "most successful mine disposal system in the world," deployed by 11 navies including the US Navy, Royal Navy, and German Navy. Units likely number in the thousands as it is a one-shot munition. [Source: marinelink.com, wikipedia.org]
- **Kongsberg HUGIN is the deep-water gold standard**: Approximately 100 large systems delivered to 12 navies. Selected for US Navy Large Displacement UUV prototype program. HUGIN Endurance offers 15-day endurance at 6,000m depth. [Source: navalnews.com, kongsberg.com]
- **Teledyne Slocum Glider has highest total unit count**: Over 1,275 units delivered globally with 600+ sold to NATO naval users. US Navy LBS-G program is the largest fleet. While a glider rather than a propelled AUV, it is critical for ASW oceanographic data. [Source: oceansciencetechnology.com, teledyne.com]
- **Boeing Orca XLUUV represents the strategic shift**: Only 5 operational prototypes contracted at $274 million, but represents the paradigm shift to submarine-sized autonomous vehicles for minelaying, ASW, and electronic warfare with 6,500nm range. [Source: nridigital.com, naval-technology.com]
- **General Dynamics Knifefish is the US Navy's buried mine hunter**: Low-Rate Initial Production of 5 systems (10 vehicles) for Littoral Combat Ships. Block 1 retrofit contract valued at $72.8 million. [Source: gdmissionsystems.com, govconwire.com]
- **Exail (ECA Group) leads integrated MCM drone systems**: The Belgium/Netherlands rMCM program involves 12 vessels equipped with ~100 drones including A18-M AUVs and hundreds of K-STER mine disposal vehicles. Won a "several hundred million euro" contract in February 2025 with an undisclosed navy. [Source: navalnews.com]
- **Saab Double Eagle is the standard European MCM hybrid**: Over 70 systems delivered, operating as both tethered ROV and untethered AUV. Standard equipment on multiple European MCM vessel classes. [Source: saab.com]
- **L3Harris Iver4 is gaining traction**: Selected for UK Royal Navy Project Wilton and US Navy Next Generation Small-Class MEMUUV program. [Source: navaltoday.com, hydro-international.com]
- **VideoRay Defender standardized for EOD**: $92.6 million IDIQ contract with US Navy plus $30.7 million follow-on. Deployed by US Navy, Coast Guard, and 20 allied navies. [Source: videoray.com]
- **Market growing at 6.8-10.6% CAGR**: From $4-6 billion in 2025 to $8-10 billion by 2030, driven by Asia-Pacific naval modernization, seabed infrastructure protection post-Nord Stream, and transition from prototype to program-of-record. [Source: mordorintelligence.com, marketsandmarkets.com]
- **Three historical eras of military UUVs**: ROV era (1970s-1990s, led by ECA PAP 104 with 500+ units), shallow water AUV era (2000s-2015, catalyzed by REMUS 100 in Iraq 2003), and the current standoff/large displacement era (2015-present). [Source: deagel.com]

## Open Questions

### China's UUV Inventory

**Status:** Filtered
Redundant with pending "Major UMV Buyers & Global Procurement Programs" deep research, which covers navies as largest buyers and regional market dynamics.
The PLA Navy operates the HSU-001 and other UUV platforms, but specific deployment numbers and procurement data remain classified. Verified sightings exist but no official figures.

### SeaFox Expenditure Rates

**Status:** Filtered
Irrelevant to desired output. The HTML report needs vehicle profiles with sales/deployment numbers and use cases, not expendable munition consumption rates. Existing data (11 navies, thousands of units) is sufficient for the vehicle card.
As a one-shot expendable munition, annual consumption rates for training vs. combat operations are not publicly disclosed. This data would clarify the recurring revenue model vs. one-time platform sales.

### Ghost Shark Production Numbers

**Status:** Filtered
Redundant with pending "Emerging Next-Generation UUV Programs" deep research, which specifically covers Ghost Shark and other next-gen military UUV programs.
The Australian Ghost Shark (Anduril) program is valued at A$1.7 billion, but the specific number of hulls to be produced is unconfirmed beyond "dozens."

### Ukraine Black Sea UUV Operations

**Status:** Filtered
Irrelevant to desired output. The HTML report focuses on vehicle profiles and market data, not operational deployment details of ongoing conflicts. Existing vehicle data is sufficient.
While Ukrainian USV operations are well-documented, the extent of Western UUV supply (REMUS, SeaFox) for Black Sea mine clearing operations is not fully public.

### Exact L3Harris Iver Sales Figures

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
L3Harris has shipped over 375 AUVs total across the Iver product line, updating the previous "350+" estimate. Breakdown by variant or customer segment is not publicly available. See [details](./QUICK_l3harris-iver-sales-figures.md).
While confirmed in use by US Navy and Royal Navy, total production numbers for the Iver series remain unpublished by L3Harris.
