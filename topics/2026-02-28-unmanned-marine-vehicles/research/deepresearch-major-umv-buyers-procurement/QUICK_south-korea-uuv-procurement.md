# Quick Research: South Korea UUV Procurement Numbers

**Source question:** deepresearch-major-umv-buyers-procurement, Open Question #2
**Resolved:** 2026-02-28T22:18:37Z

## Findings

### MRXUUV Program (Hanwha Systems)

- **Contract:** 25 billion won (~$19M USD) awarded November 2023
- **Contractor:** Hanwha Systems in consortium with Hanwha Ocean Co.
- **Client:** Agency for Defense Development (ADD), for the Republic of Korea Navy
- **Deliverable:** Prototype of a Mission Reconfigurable eXtra-large Unmanned Underwater Vehicle
- **Deadline:** August 2027
- **Capabilities:** Long-range autonomous reconnaissance, mine installation, modular mission reconfiguration
- **Propulsion:** Hydrogen fuel cell / AIP for up to 30-day endurance

### Additional UUV Programs (Hanwha Ocean)

In April 2024, Hanwha Ocean was contracted to design:
- A reconnaissance UUV for the ROK Navy
- A mine warfare USV for the ROK Navy

These are separate from the MRXUUV program and represent a broadening of South Korea's unmanned maritime portfolio.

### US-Korea Underwater Drone Swarm Partnership

- **Date:** December 2025
- **Partners:** Hanwha Group + Vatn Systems (US startup)
- **Platform:** Skelmir S6 — torpedo-shaped vehicles, 50-60 lbs, ~6 inches diameter
- **Specs:** Up to 20 knots, 20 nm range, 100m depth, 10-20 lb payloads
- **Purpose:** Low-cost surveillance and strike drones for the US Navy, with applicability to ROK Navy
- **Hanwha investment:** Reported $60M funding round in Vatn Systems

### Fleet Target Assessment

Exact fleet procurement numbers remain unpublished. However, the program structure confirms:
1. **Large autonomous platforms:** At least 1 MRXUUV prototype, with production intent for the ROK Navy
2. **Small attritable swarms:** Partnership with Vatn for mass-producible torpedo-shaped drones (quantity-focused)
3. **Reconnaissance & MCM:** Separate design contracts for specialized UUVs/USVs

The ROK Navy's strategy appears to mirror the US "exquisite + attritable" dual approach.

### Relevance to Report

This data enriches buyer information for existing vehicle cards (Hanwha MRXUUV in Section 2) and provides context for the ROK Navy as a notable buyer in the procurement landscape. South Korea is a significant but mid-tier buyer compared to the US, Australia, and Taiwan.
