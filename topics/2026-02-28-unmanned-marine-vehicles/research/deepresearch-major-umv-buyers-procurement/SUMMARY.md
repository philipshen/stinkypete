# Summary: Major UMV Buyers & Global Procurement Programs

## Abstract

The global UMV procurement landscape has shifted decisively from experimentation to serial production. The United States Navy is the largest single spender with ~$1.7B for USVs and $734M for UUVs in FY2026 alone, pursuing both exquisite platforms (Orca XLUUV) and mass-producible attritable systems (Replicator). China matches the US in ambition with the JARI-USV-A combat trimaran and large UUV programs. The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing theater, highlighted by Taiwan's unprecedented order of 1,320 "Kuai Chi" attack USVs, Japan's $641M SHIELD network allocation, and Australia's $1.1B Ghost Shark program with Anduril. In Europe, the Belgian-Dutch rMCM program (€2B for 12 motherships + 100+ drones) sets the MCM automation standard, while the Middle East shifts toward licensed domestic production with Turkey as a key supplier.

## Key Insights

- **US Navy is the top spender**: FY2026 allocates ~$1.7B for USVs and $734M for UUVs, spanning Orca XLUUV, Replicator attritable swarms, LUSV/MUSV large combatants, and Lionfish/Viperfish small/medium UUVs [Source: insideunmannedsystems.com, defensescoop.com, navy.mil]
- **China fields combat-capable USVs at scale**: The JARI-USV-A "Orca" is a 58m, 420-500 ton trimaran with VLS, torpedo tubes, and phased array radar — essentially a mini-Aegis drone ship. Swarm motherships like Zhu Hai Yun also in service [Source: euro-sd.com, globaltimes.cn]

## Open Questions

### Exact Chinese UMV budget allocations

**Status:** Filtered
Reason: Budget allocation question that is unanswerable through open-source research. Key Chinese vehicles (JARI-USV-A, AJX002) are already profiled with available data.

### South Korea's specific UUV procurement numbers

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)

Hanwha Systems received a 25 billion won (~$19M) contract in Nov 2023 for an MRXUUV prototype due Aug 2027, in consortium with Hanwha Ocean. In Dec 2025, Hanwha partnered with US startup Vatn Systems for underwater drone swarms (Skelmir S6 platform, 50-60 lb torpedo-shaped vehicles). Exact fleet targets remain unpublished, but the program structure confirms ROK Navy pursuing both large autonomous UUVs and small attritable swarm systems. See QUICK_south-korea-uuv-procurement.md for full findings.

### Turkey's UMV export pipeline beyond Saudi Arabia

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)

Qatar became the first ULAQ armed USV export customer in Oct 2024 (QAR 21.3M / $5.85M contract), with delivery to the Qatar Coast Guard in Dec 2025. Vietnam has been offered the ULAQ PSV variant. Countries in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa have expressed interest. Aselsan signed $171M in USV subsystem/payload export contracts with Asia-Pacific customers. New ULAQ export contracts expected to be announced during 2026. See QUICK_turkey-umv-exports.md for full findings.

### Replicator program total unit targets

**Status:** Filtered
Reason: Aggregate unit targets are partially classified and unanswerable through open-source research. Individual vendor contracts (MAPC 32 units/month, Saronic $392M) are already captured in the key insights.

### India XLUUV vendor selection timeline

**Status:** Filtered
Reason: Too early-stage for vehicle cards — tender issued Jan 2026, no production contract or defined vehicle yet. Existing summary already captures the ~$300M tender and early awardees.
