TOPIC: Major UMV Buyers & Global Procurement Programs

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into the Unmanned Marine Vehicle (UMV) market, covering both Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). The end goal is a comprehensive market report identifying the top 15 UMVs by sales, 10 up-and-coming UUVs, and honorable mentions. This specific research focuses on the BUYER side — which navies and organizations are purchasing these systems, what their budgets are, and what specific procurement programs exist.

We already know from prior research that:
- The military UUV market is $4-6 billion (2025), projected to reach $8-10 billion by 2030
- HII's REMUS series leads in unit volume (700+ sold to 30 countries)
- Atlas Elektronik's SeaFox leads in expendable mine disposal
- The USV market is $0.82-1.5 billion (2025), projected to reach $3.5 billion by 2034
- OceanAlpha has delivered 4,000+ USVs
- Ukraine's Magura V5 has validated the combat attritable USV concept
- The commercial/scientific UMV market is ~$5.2 billion (2025)

Please provide:
