# Major UMV Buyers & Global Procurement Programs: A Comprehensive Market Report

**Executive Summary**

The global market for Unmanned Marine Vehicles (UMVs), encompassing both Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), is currently undergoing a radical transformation driven by the geopolitical exigencies of high-intensity conflict and the commercial imperatives of the blue economy. As of late 2025 and early 2026, the procurement landscape is characterized by a definitive shift from experimental prototyping to serial production and fleet integration. The conflict in Ukraine has validated the concept of the "attritable" combat USV, spurring nations such as Taiwan, Japan, and the United States to accelerate programs that favor mass and lethality over exquisite, multi-mission platforms. Simultaneously, the Mine Countermeasures (MCM) sector is leading the transition to full autonomy in Western navies, with the Belgian-Dutch rMCM and Franco-British MMCM programs setting the global standard for "stand-off" mine warfare.

This report identifies the United States Navy as the preeminent spender in absolute terms, driving high-end capabilities like the Orca XLUUV and the Replicator initiative's massed autonomous swarms. However, the Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the most dynamic procurement theater. China's deployment of the JARI-USV-A "Orca" and Taiwan's asymmetric procurement of 1,320 "Kuai Chi" attack USVs illustrate a burgeoning naval arms race centered on robotic systems. In the commercial sector, the "Data as a Service" model has matured, with operators like Ocean Infinity and Fugro completing the delivery of large-scale robotic fleets that are fundamentally altering offshore survey and inspection economics.

The following sections detail the procurement behaviors, budgets, and strategic priorities of the world's major UMV buyers, synthesized from defense contracts, budget requests, and program updates through early 2026.

## 1. Top Military Buyers by Spending and Fleet Size

The hierarchy of global UMV buyers reflects a dichotomy between established naval powers seeking high-end, long-endurance strategic assets and smaller nations or asymmetric forces prioritizing cost-effective, lethal swarms. The following ranking aggregates estimated fleet size targets, public procurement budgets, and the number of active programs.

### Tier 1: The Superpowers (System-of-Systems Integrators)

1.  **United States Navy (USN):** The undisputed leader in R&D spending and program diversity. The USN is simultaneously pursuing the largest undersea platforms (Orca XLUUV), the "Ghost Fleet" of large surface combatants (LUSV), and thousands of small, attritable systems under the Replicator initiative. The FY2026 budget request alone allocates approximately $1.7 billion for USVs and $734 million for UUVs [cite: 1, 2].
2.  **People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN - China):** China matches the US in the breadth of its unmanned ambitions, rapidly fielding combat-capable USVs like the JARI-USV-A trimaran and deploying "drone carrier" motherships. The opacity of the Chinese budget conceals exact figures, but the scale of deployment—from swarm tests to large displacement UUVs—places them firmly in the top tier [cite: 3, 4].

### Tier 2: The Modernizers (MCM and ASW Focus)

3.  **Royal Navy (United Kingdom):** A pioneer in autonomous mine hunting through the MMCM program. The UK is also aggressively pursuing large AUVs for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) via Project Cetus, having recently taken delivery of the *XV Excalibur* [cite: 5].
4.  **Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF):** Driven by the "SHIELD" autonomous defense network concept, Japan has approved record defense budgets (FY2026) with over $640 million earmarked specifically for unmanned coastal defense systems [cite: 6].
5.  **Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN):** South Korea is heavily investing in ASW-capable UUVs and combat USVs, partnering with domestic giants like Hanwha and US startups to field underwater swarms against North Korean threats [cite: 7, 8].
6.  **Royal Australian Navy (RAN):** Australia has vaulted into the top tier with the "Ghost Shark" program, a $1.7 billion commitment to co-develop and produce Extra-Large AUVs (XL-AUVs) with Anduril [cite: 9].
7.  **French Navy (Marine Nationale):** A leader in the European MCM sector, France continues to procure advanced AUVs (A-18M) and USVs under the SLAM-F program to replace legacy minehunters [cite: 10, 11].

### Tier 3: The Asymmetric & Emerging Buyers

8.  **Taiwan (ROC Navy):** Adopting a "porcupine strategy," Taiwan has authorized the mass procurement of 1,320 "Kuai Chi" attack USVs, creating one of the world's largest planned fleets of weaponized maritime drones [cite: 12].
9.  **Indian Navy:** India is formalizing its unmanned capabilities with a tender for 12 XLUUVs and the acquisition of man-portable UUVs for mine countermeasures, bridging the gap in its conventional submarine capabilities [cite: 13].
10. **NATO (Belgian-Dutch rMCM):** This binational program represents the largest single export contract for MCM drone systems in the world, procuring 12 motherships and over 100 assorted drones (USVs, UUVs, UAVs) [cite: 14].
11. **Turkish Navy:** Turkey has transitioned from a drone operator to a major producer-buyer. The ULAQ and MARLIN USV programs are entering service, and Turkey is exporting this doctrine to the Gulf [cite: 15].
12. **Israeli Navy:** A long-time innovator with the Protector USV, Israel is now integrating larger platforms like the Seagull and participating in advanced submarine-hunting AUV programs (BlueWhale) [cite: 16].
13. **Russian Navy:** Despite sanctions, Russia maintains high-priority strategic programs like the Poseidon nuclear torpedo and the Klavesin-2R-PM deep-sea AUV, alongside attempts to field tactical USVs like the "Briz" for the Ukraine theater [cite: 17, 18].
14. **Ukraine:** While operating on a war footing with opaque budgets, Ukraine operates the world's most combat-experienced USV fleet (Magura V5, Sea Baby), driving global doctrine [cite: 19].
15. **Singapore (RSN):** A sophisticated buyer integrating USVs for maritime security and procuring a full suite of MCM unmanned systems to replace manned minehunters by 2027 [cite: 20].

## 3. Regional Market Dynamics

### 3.1. North America
The **United States** remains the center of gravity for high-end technology development. The market is driven by the "Great Power Competition" with China. Key dynamic: The Pentagon is trying to break its own acquisition bureaucracy through the **Replicator** initiative, forcing a shift from multi-year development cycles to 18-24 month fielding timelines. Canada is a participant in NATO's MUS initiative but lags in major indigenous platform procurement compared to the US.

### 3.2. Europe
Europe is the global hub for **Mine Countermeasures (MCM)** automation. The continent's shallow, complex littorals (Baltic, North Sea) and the legacy of WWI/WWII naval mines drive this focus.
*   **NATO/Nordics:** Heavy investment in AUVs for infrastructure protection (Nord Stream aftermath). Germany and Norway are procuring high-end AUVs (HUGIN, BlueWhale).
*   **UK/France/Benelux:** Integrated programs (MMCM, rMCM) are creating a standardized market for Thales and Exail systems.
*   **Ukraine Effect:** European nations are closely watching the Black Sea, leading to interest in weaponized USVs (e.g., Germany's FCSS interest).

### 3.3. Asia-Pacific
This is the fastest-growing region for **Combat USVs and UUVs**.
*   **China vs. First Island Chain:** China's rapid naval expansion is being met by asymmetric responses from Taiwan (massed USVs), Japan (SHIELD network), and Australia (Ghost Shark).
*   **South Korea:** Focusing on anti-submarine capabilities to counter North Korea's submersible fleet.
*   **India:** seeking to mitigate the delay in its manned submarine programs (Project 75I) by leapfrogging to XLUUVs.

### 3.4. Middle East
The region is shifting from **Import to Licensed Production**.
*   **Tech Transfer:** Saudi Arabia and UAE (EDGE Group) are mandating local production in their USV contracts.
*   **Partnerships:** Turkey has become a key supplier (ULAQ), displacing some traditional Western suppliers. Israel remains a technology provider (e.g., to Germany and UAE via EDGE/IAI collaboration) despite domestic procurement challenges.

## 4. Commercial & Scientific Buyers

The commercial UMV market is dominated by the "Data as a Service" model, where clients pay for survey data rather than buying the vessels.

1.  **Ocean Infinity:**
    *   **Fleet:** "Armada" fleet of 14 robotic vessels (78m and 86m classes).
    *   **Status:** Final vessel delivered December 2025. 12 vessels operational as of early 2026 [cite: 54, 55].
    *   **Operations:** Global geophysical and geotechnical surveys for offshore wind and oil & gas.

2.  **Fugro:**
    *   **Fleet:** "Blue" series (Blue Essence, Blue Eclipse, Blue Prism).
    *   **Developments:** Deploying 18m *Blue Eclipse* USV for Norway's MAREANO seabed mapping program in 2025—the first use of USVs in this national program [cite: 56, 57].
    *   **Strategy:** Expanding USV fleet to reduce carbon footprint and personnel risk.

3.  **XOCEAN:**
    *   **Focus:** Carbon-neutral ocean data using smaller USVs (XO-450).
    *   **Growth:** Raised €115 million in Jan 2025 to expand fleet [cite: 58].

## 5. Procurement Trends

1.  **Attritable Mass:** Post-Ukraine, navies are moving away from "gold-plated" multifunction drones to cheaper, single-purpose systems that can be lost in combat without strategic impact. (e.g., Replicator, Kuai Chi).
2.  **Data as a Service (DaaS):** In the commercial sector, ownership is declining. Energy companies contract Fugro or Ocean Infinity to deliver the map, not the ship. This shifts capital expenditure risk to the service providers.
3.  **Mothership Concepts:** Navies are procuring platforms specifically to host unmanned systems (e.g., Belgium's City-class MCMV, China's *Zhu Hai Yun*). The "toolbox" approach allows the ship to remain relevant by swapping out the drones it carries.
4.  **COTS & Collaboration:** Military buyers are increasingly purchasing modified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technology to speed up fielding. AUKUS Pillar 2 is facilitating rapid technology transfer (e.g., UK/Australia interoperability trials with *Excalibur* and *Ghost Shark*).
5.  **Seabed Warfare:** The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline has made "Seabed Warfare" a priority procurement category. Nations are buying AUVs capable of inspecting and protecting critical underwater infrastructure (CUI).
