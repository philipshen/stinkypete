**Source question:** deepresearch-major-umv-buyers-procurement, Open Question #3
**Resolved:** 2026-02-28T22:18:37Z

## Findings

### Confirmed Export: Qatar (ULAQ Armed USV)

- **Contract signed:** October 2024 at DIMDEX 2024, Doha
- **Value:** QAR 21.3 million (~$5.85M USD), signed during Milipol Qatar 2024
- **Delivery:** December 2025, to the Qatar Coast Guard Command
- **Significance:** Turkey's first-ever export of an unmanned surface vehicle
- **Manufacturer:** Ares Shipyard / ULAQ Global (joint venture of Ares Shipyard and Meteksan Defence)

### Pipeline Markets

- **Vietnam:** Offered the ULAQ PSV (Port Security Vessel) variant with KMC-U launcher
- **Middle East, Asia, Africa:** Multiple countries have expressed interest (specifics undisclosed)
- **Under consideration:** One to five anti-surface warfare vessels, port security vessels, and expendable vessels for an unnamed foreign customer

### ULAQ Product Family (2025-2026)

- **ULAQ Armed USV:** Anti-surface warfare, 400km range, armed with CIRIT/L-UMTAS missiles
- **ULAQ 15 MPV:** New multi-purpose variant unveiled at EDEX 2025
- **ULAQ PSV:** Port security variant

### Subsystem Exports (Aselsan)

- **Value:** $171 million in total export contracts signed with Asia-Pacific customers
- **Products:** Communications systems and payloads for USVs
- **Significance:** Turkey exporting not just platforms but also the subsystem/payload ecosystem

### Related Programs

Through experience from MARLIN, SANCAR, and ULAQ programs, Turkey has built a comprehensive USV industrial base. Ares Shipyard expects additional export contracts to be publicly announced during 2026.

### 2026 Outlook

Turkey is positioning itself as the "Bayraktar TB2 of naval drones" — leveraging combat-proven, affordable platforms for export to non-Western aligned buyers. The Qatar delivery validates the export model and is expected to catalyze further sales.

### Relevance to Report

ULAQ could appear as an honorable mention in Section 3 (top-selling USVs) given it has only 1 confirmed export customer. Key card fields: vehicle name (ULAQ Armed USV), manufacturer (Ares Shipyard / Meteksan Defence), buyers (Qatar Coast Guard, Turkey Navy), sales (limited — 1 export contract, domestic use), use cases (anti-surface warfare, port security), why it didn't make the cut (very early export stage, limited volume compared to QinetiQ, OceanAlpha, etc.).
