# Quick Research: Chinese XXL UUV Propulsion and Capabilities

**Source question:** deepresearch-emerging-next-gen-uuv-programs, Open Question #1

## Findings

### AJX002 — Publicly Revealed Designation

China publicly unveiled the AJX002 extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle at a September 2025 military parade, marking the first official acknowledgment of the program. The designation "AJX002" was painted in large white letters on the vehicle, though the exact meaning of the "AJX" prefix remains unclear.

### Physical Specifications

- **Length:** 18-20 meters (the parade vehicle; larger 40m+ variants observed separately at Sanya)
- **Diameter:** 1-1.5 meters
- **Design:** Torpedo-shaped with pump-jet propulsion and cruciform rudders
- **Launch method:** Crane-deployed (four lifting lugs along hull); may be modular/separable into two sections for transport

### Propulsion Assessment

- **Assessed as diesel-electric** with high-capacity lithium-ion batteries
- Housing in floating dry docks at Sanya suggests conventional fuel systems (no complex/sensitive fuel supplies like liquid oxygen needed)
- **No evidence of nuclear propulsion**, despite speculation given the size of the 40m+ variants
- Pump-jet propulsion designed for acoustic stealth

### Intended Capabilities

- **Officially described as optimized for mine-laying operations** during the parade
- Additional assessed capabilities: silent mine deployment in critical shipping routes, patrol in contested waters, potential threat to undersea infrastructure
- Strategic context: Reinforcing naval pressure over the Taiwan Strait

### Broader Program

- The AJX002 is **one of at least 6 distinct XLUUV designs** undergoing testing since at least 2022
- The two larger variants (40m+) at Sanya are separate from the parade AJX002 and remain less well-characterized
- Satellite imagery and trial reports confirm multiple types under development

### Relevance to Report

This data supports vehicle cards for China's XLUUV programs in Section 2 (Up-and-Coming UUVs) or Section 3 (Honorable Mentions). Key card fields now available: vehicle name (AJX002), manufacturer (PLA Navy / Chinese defense industry, specific yard unconfirmed), development stage (testing/parade reveal), target buyer (PLA Navy), use cases (mine-laying, ISR, area denial), notable feature (largest known unmanned submarines, at least 6 variants).
