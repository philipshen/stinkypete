TOPIC: Emerging Next-Generation UUV Programs

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into the Unmanned Marine Vehicle (UMV) market, specifically identifying the top 15 UMVs by sales, 10 up-and-coming UUVs, and honorable mentions. This sub-topic focuses on new UUV platforms currently in development or recently launched that represent the next generation of underwater unmanned vehicles.

Please provide:
1. A comprehensive analysis of emerging next-generation UUV programs, including but not limited to:
   - Anduril Industries Dive-LD (Large Displacement UUV)
   - Australia's Ghost Shark (developed by Anduril Australia)
   - Northrop Grumman Manta Ray
   - Boeing Orca (Extra Large UUV / XLUUV)
   - L3Harris Iver4 series and any next-gen successors
   - MSubs S201 and other XLUUV programs
   - General Atomics / Bluefin Robotics next-gen platforms
   - Any Chinese, Russian, European, South Korean, Japanese, or other national emerging UUV programs
   - DARPA-funded or government-backed experimental UUV programs
   - Any startup or non-traditional defense company UUV programs

2. For each program, provide:
   - Current development stage (concept, prototype, testing, low-rate initial production, operational)
   - Manufacturer/developer and key partners
   - Target buyers (which navies or organizations)
   - Key specifications (size class, endurance, depth rating, payload capacity where known)
   - Intended use cases (ISR, mine countermeasures, ASW, strike, logistics, etc.)
   - What makes it notable or innovative compared to existing platforms
   - Estimated timeline to operational capability
   - Approximate program value or unit cost if known
   - Any recent contract awards, test milestones, or program updates (especially 2024-2026)

3. All source URLs for claims made

4. A list of open questions or areas that need further investigation, such as:
   - Programs with limited public information
   - Classified or export-restricted programs that may be significant
   - Technology readiness levels that are uncertain
   - Budget or timeline risks

Focus on accuracy and cite your sources. Prioritize programs that are most likely to reach operational deployment and have the greatest market impact.
