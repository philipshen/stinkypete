# Summary: Emerging Next-Generation UUV Programs

## Abstract

The next-generation UUV market is undergoing a paradigm shift from small, short-endurance systems to large and extra-large platforms capable of autonomous operations lasting weeks to months. The market is bifurcating between "exquisite" multi-mission systems (Boeing Orca, ~$274M for 5 units) and "attritable" mass-producible systems (Anduril Ghost Shark, $1.1B AUD program). Major operational milestones are clustered in 2024-2026, with Ghost Shark entering production, Orca beginning at-sea testing, Manta Ray completing full-scale demonstrations, and China revealing 40m+ XXL UUVs at Sanya naval base.

## Key Insights

- **Anduril Ghost Shark dominates the emerging XLUUV space**: Went from concept to a $1.7B AUD ($1.1B USD) program of record in under five years, with first prototype delivered to the Royal Australian Navy in April 2024 (one year ahead of schedule). Uses 3D-printed hulls and Lattice OS for collaborative autonomy. Full-rate production negotiations announced August 2025 with entry into service early 2026.

## Open Questions

### Chinese XXL UUV Propulsion and Capabilities

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)

The AJX002 designation was publicly revealed at a September 2025 military parade. The vehicle measures 18-20m with pump-jet propulsion and cruciform rudders. Officially described as optimized for mine-laying. Propulsion is assessed as diesel-electric with high-capacity lithium-ion batteries (no evidence of nuclear propulsion). At least 6 distinct XLUUV designs are undergoing testing. Two larger 40m+ variants observed at Sanya are housed in floating docks, suggesting conventional fuel systems. See QUICK_chinese-xxl-uuv-details.md for full findings.

### Autonomous Weapons Release Protocols

### Russian Poseidon Verification

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)

Putin announced in October 2025 a successful test launch from a carrier submarine with nuclear power unit activation. The Khabarovsk (Project 09851) carrier submarine was launched 1 November 2025. USNI Proceedings (Jan 2026) and IISS (Nov 2025) assessed that independent verification remains lacking. Specs: 20-24m long, ~70 knots, 3,000ft depth, 5,000+ nm range. Still in development, not yet operationally deployed. See QUICK_poseidon-verification.md for full findings.
