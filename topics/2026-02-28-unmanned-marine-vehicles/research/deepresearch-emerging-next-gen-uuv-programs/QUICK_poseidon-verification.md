# Quick Research: Russian Poseidon Verification

**Source question:** deepresearch-emerging-next-gen-uuv-programs, Open Question #3
**Resolved:** 2026-02-28T22:18:37Z

## Findings

### October 2025 Test Announcement

President Putin announced in October 2025 that Russia had, "for the first time, managed not only to launch [Poseidon] with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time." This was characterized as the first combined test of launch and nuclear propulsion.

### Khabarovsk Carrier Submarine

The Project 09851 Khabarovsk nuclear-powered submarine — designed specifically to carry Poseidon torpedoes — was launched on 1 November 2025. This is the first purpose-built carrier for the system.

### Technical Specifications (Consolidated)

- **Length:** 20-24 meters (65-80 feet)
- **Speed:** ~70 knots
- **Depth:** Up to 3,000 feet (1,000m)
- **Range:** 5,000+ nautical miles (nuclear-powered, theoretically unlimited)
- **Warhead:** Nuclear (multi-megaton), designed to create radioactive contamination of coastal areas
- **Classification:** Strategic nuclear weapon / autonomous torpedo

### Verification Assessment

- **IISS (November 2025):** Analyzed the test announcement but noted lack of independent verification
- **Arms Control Association (November 2025):** Reported the test but flagged reliance on Russian state media
- **USNI Proceedings (January 2026):** Published analysis of Khabarovsk/Poseidon strategic implications, assessing the system as changing the nuclear dynamic but still in development
- **Expert consensus:** "Nothing revolutionary" about the nuclear propulsion concept, but independent confirmation of test success remains absent

### Operational Status

Still in development. Not operationally deployed. The Khabarovsk carrier submarine exists but the weapon system has not been declared at initial operating capability (IOC).

### Relevance to Report

Poseidon is relevant as an honorable mention in Section 3 (up-and-coming UUVs that didn't make the top 10) due to its unverified status and classification as a strategic nuclear weapon rather than a conventional UMV. Card fields: vehicle name (Poseidon/Status-6), manufacturer (Rubin Design Bureau), development stage (testing, unverified), target buyer (Russian Navy), use cases (strategic nuclear deterrent), why it didn't make the cut (unverified, nuclear doomsday weapon class rather than conventional UMV).
