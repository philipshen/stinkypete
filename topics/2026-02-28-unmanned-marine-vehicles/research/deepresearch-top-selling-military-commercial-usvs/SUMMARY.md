# Summary: Top-Selling Military & Commercial USVs

## Abstract

The global USV market is projected to grow from approximately $0.82-1.5 billion in 2025 to over $3.5 billion by 2034, driven by two major forces: combat-validated attritable systems (exemplified by Ukraine's Magura V5 and Sea Baby drones) and the commercial "Data-as-a-Service" model pioneered by companies like Saildrone and XOCEAN. Military platforms dominate revenue (~52-55% market share) due to high unit costs, while commercial platforms lead in unit volume, with China's OceanAlpha alone having delivered over 4,000 USVs. The U.S. DoD's "Replicator" initiative is catalyzing a shift from low-rate to mass production, with companies like MAPC ramping to 32 units per month and Saronic securing a $392M contract for the Corsair platform.

## Open Questions

### What are China's military USV production rates?

**Status:** Filtered
Redundant with pending "Major UMV Buyers & Global Procurement Programs" deep research, which covers regional market dynamics and procurement programs including China.
While OceanAlpha publishes commercial figures (4,000+ units), the production rates of PLA-N combat USVs like the JARI series remain opaque and undisclosed.

### What are the actual attrition rates for Ukrainian naval drones?

**Status:** Filtered
Irrelevant to desired output. Attrition rates are operational metrics; the HTML report needs vehicle profiles with production numbers, capabilities, and buyers, all of which are already available.
Precise data on how many Magura V5 and Sea Baby drones are lost per successful strike operation is not publicly available, which impacts total production/deployment estimates.

### How quickly will autonomous USV regulatory frameworks expand?

**Status:** Filtered
Irrelevant to desired output. The HTML report is a vehicle market report with vehicle cards, not a regulatory analysis. Regulatory frameworks are not a data field in any section of the desired output.
The UK MCA granted Category 0 (unrestricted) approval to Fugro's Blue Essence, and the UAE has flagged USVs -- but the pace at which other maritime nations will follow with similar regulatory frameworks is uncertain.

### What are the specific per-vendor unit orders under Replicator?

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
MAPC GARC production ramped to 32 units/month under $160M commitment; Saronic Corsair secured $392M contract but has not disclosed production rates; overall Replicator allocated ~$1B for FY24-25. Exact per-vendor unit counts remain partially classified. See [details](./QUICK_replicator-per-vendor-orders.md).
Dollar amounts for individual vendors under the U.S. DoD Replicator initiative are often aggregated; precise per-vendor unit orders and delivery schedules remain partially classified.

### What is the total L3Harris USV fleet size post-ASV Global acquisition?

**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
L3Harris has 125+ USVs in operation worldwide across C-Worker, C-Target, MAST-13, and custom platforms, with 2,100+ cumulative hours at sea. See [details](./QUICK_l3harris-usv-fleet-post-asv-global.md).
L3Harris absorbed ASV Global's fleet of 100+ delivered systems, but the current combined operational fleet size across MAST-13, C-Worker, C-Target, and MUSV prototype programs needs clarification.
