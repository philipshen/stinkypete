# Quick Research: L3Harris Total USV Fleet Size Post-ASV Global Acquisition

## Question
What is the total L3Harris USV fleet size after absorbing ASV Global?

## Findings

L3Harris (via its ASV Global subsidiary) has **more than 125 USVs in operation** worldwide, with over **2,100+ cumulative hours at sea**. Other sources cite "more than 100 systems delivered" across defense, oil & gas, and scientific sectors.

The fleet spans multiple product lines:
- **C-Worker series** (C-Worker 4, 5, 7, 15) - commercial survey and inspection
- **C-Target** - naval target drone
- **MAST-13** - military USV
- **Custom ASV** - bespoke platforms for specific mission requirements

L3Harris does not publicly break down fleet numbers by variant or customer segment. The "125+ in operation" figure likely represents the current active fleet (some older units may be decommissioned), while "100+ delivered" may be a conservative earlier figure.

This is distinct from the L3Harris Iver AUV line (375+ units), which is a separate underwater vehicle product.
