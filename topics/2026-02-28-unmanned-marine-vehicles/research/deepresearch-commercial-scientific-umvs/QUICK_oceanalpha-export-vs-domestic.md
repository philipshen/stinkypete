# Quick Research: OceanAlpha Export vs. Domestic Sales Breakdown

## Question
What is the breakdown between OceanAlpha's domestic Chinese government sales and genuine export sales to international markets?

## Findings

A precise quantitative breakdown between domestic and export sales is **not publicly available**. However, key indicators suggest a predominantly domestic customer base with growing international presence:

### International Reach
- Operating in **40+ countries** worldwide (per company website)
- Active international sales efforts with demonstrations in Malaysia, Dubai, and at Ocean Business 2025 (UK)
- Unveiled the **L42 USV** (large 42m platform) at Ocean Business 2025, targeting international offshore energy clients

### Domestic Activity
- Electric-propelled USVs being deployed for goods transportation in the **South China Sea**
- Strong domestic government and environmental monitoring contracts
- Company headquarters and primary manufacturing in Zhuhai, Guangdong

### Assessment
Given the 3,990+ total USVs delivered, the majority are likely smaller inland/coastal survey models sold domestically (water quality monitoring, hydrographic survey for Chinese waterways and ports). The international 40+ countries figure likely represents a smaller share of total units but potentially a growing share of revenue, especially for larger offshore-capable models. OceanAlpha does not publish annual reports with segmented geographic revenue data.
