# Quick Research: True Fleet Sizes for DaaS Operators

## Question
What are the actual current fleet sizes for Saildrone, XOCEAN, and Bedrock Ocean?

## Findings

### Saildrone
- **136 vehicles** as of October 2023 across three variants (Explorer, Voyager, Surveyor)
- Production rate as of late 2023: **1 Voyager (33ft) per week** and **1 Surveyor (65ft) per month**
- At that rate, the fleet would have grown to approximately **200+ vehicles** by early 2026
- Long-term goal: **1,000 USVs** for planetary-scale ocean monitoring
- In October 2025, Lockheed Martin invested **$50M** in Saildrone to scale USV manufacturing, with large vessel construction beginning at Austal USA in Q1 2026
- Recent deployment: **20 Voyager USVs** deployed simultaneously for Operation Southern Spear (drug interdiction) in 2025 -- the largest single deployment to date
- Danish Armed Forces began operational testing of **4 Voyager USVs** in June 2025
- Armed variant development underway: Lockheed Martin JAGM Quad Launcher integration on Surveyor, live-fire demonstrations planned for summer 2026

### XOCEAN
- Fleet of **XO-450 series** USVs; at least **16 vessels built** as of early 2022 (vessel designated X-16 launched January 2022)
- Planned to **double fleet** during 2022
- Raised **$119M** in January 2025 for geographic expansion and fleet growth
- Estimated current fleet: **25-30+ vessels** (based on doubling from 16 and continued expansion)
- XOCEAN describes itself as operating "the world's largest fleet of survey-class USVs"
- Planning commercial USV production facility that could create 1,000+ jobs

### Bedrock Ocean Exploration
- Raised **$25M Series A** in June 2025 for fleet expansion
- Fleet size appears to be in **single digits** (demonstrated multi-AUV operations with 2 vehicles)
- Company vision: a single 40-foot support ship could carry **10-12 AUVs**
- Focus on cloud-connected, AI-processed seafloor mapping data
- In active expansion phase with fleet buildout underway
