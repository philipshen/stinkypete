TOPIC: UUV/UMV Startup Disruptors — Emerging companies challenging incumbents in the unmanned marine vehicle market

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into the global Unmanned Marine Vehicle (UMV) market, covering both Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). We have already researched the top-selling military UUVs (dominated by HII REMUS, Atlas Elektronik SeaFox), top military and commercial USVs (Saildrone, OceanAlpha, Ukraine's Magura V5), and commercial/scientific UMVs (Teledyne Slocum Glider, OceanAlpha). Now we need to understand the startup ecosystem disrupting this space.

Please provide:

1. A comprehensive analysis of startup companies disrupting the UUV/UMV market, including but not limited to:
   - Terradepth (autonomous submarine data platforms)
   - Blueye Robotics (consumer/prosumer underwater drones)
   - Seasats (persistent ocean monitoring)
   - Neptune Robotics (underwater inspection)
   - Bedrock Ocean Exploration (autonomous underwater mapping)
   - Nauticus Robotics / Nauticus Defense (AI-powered ocean robots)
   - Exail (formerly ECA Group / iXblue, underwater drones and autonomy)
   - Forssea Robotics (AI-powered underwater robots)
   - Planck Aerosystems / maritime drone startups
   - Houston Mechatronics (underwater robotics, Aquanaut)
   - Cellula Robotics (hydrogen fuel cell UUVs)
   - Open Ocean Robotics (autonomous USVs)
   - Marine Advanced Robotics (WAM-V)
   - Any other notable startups founded after 2010 that are challenging established players

2. For each startup, provide:
   - Founding year and headquarters
   - Total funding raised (venture capital, government grants, contracts)
   - Key products and their specifications
   - Target markets (defense, oil & gas, oceanography, aquaculture, etc.)
   - Notable contracts, deployments, or partnerships
   - What makes their approach novel or disruptive compared to incumbents
   - Current development stage (prototype, early production, scaling)
   - Key personnel (founders, CEO)

3. Analysis of disruptive trends these startups represent:
   - Software-defined ocean robotics
   - Data-as-a-Service business models
   - AI/ML for autonomous navigation and inspection
   - Democratization of underwater access (lower-cost platforms)
   - New power/propulsion systems (hydrogen fuel cells, solar, wave energy)
   - Cloud-connected ocean platforms

4. Market dynamics:
   - How are incumbents (Kongsberg, HII, L3Harris, Teledyne) responding to startup competition?
   - Which startups have been acquired by larger companies?
   - What gaps in the market are startups exploiting?
   - Estimated total venture capital invested in ocean robotics startups (2015-2025)
