# Exit Case

Research is complete when ALL of the following criteria are met:

## Section 1: Top 15 UMVs by Sales
- At least 15 unmanned marine vehicles (USVs and UUVs) identified as the highest-selling or most widely deployed
- For each: manufacturer name, primary buyers (nations/organizations), estimated sales volume or fleet size, and primary use cases
- Coverage spans both USVs (surface) and UUVs (underwater) if both have high-sales entries

## Section 2: 10 Up-and-Coming UUVs
- At least 10 new or emerging UUVs identified that are in development, recently launched, or gaining traction
- For each: manufacturer, development stage, target buyers, intended use cases, and what makes them notable
- These should be genuinely new/emerging — not established legacy platforms

## Section 3: Honorable Mentions
- At least 5 honorable mentions across both categories (established and emerging)
- For each: same data breakdown as the category they were considered for, plus a note explaining why they didn't make the top list

## General Quality
- All claims backed by citations from deep research sources
- Sufficient detail to distinguish between vehicles (not just names — specs, buyers, and use cases)
- Coverage includes military, commercial, and scientific UMV segments
