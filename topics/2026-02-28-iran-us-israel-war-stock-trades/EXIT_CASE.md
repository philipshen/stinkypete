# Exit Case

Research is complete when ALL of the following are satisfied:

1. **Sector coverage**: At least one deep research topic completed for each of the 8 sectors: Defense/Aerospace, Energy/Oil, Cybersecurity, Gold/Precious Metals, Shipping/Logistics, Israeli Defense, Nuclear/Uranium, and Historical Precedents.
2. **Trade card data sufficiency**: For each sector, the completed research contains enough data to populate at least 2 trade cards with: ticker, investment thesis, directional call (long/short/hedge), approximate price targets or percentage moves, risk level, and at least 1 citation.
3. **Risk/reward calibration**: At least 3 sectors have quantitative risk/reward data (e.g., EPS sensitivity, historical drawdown percentages, price target ranges) — not just qualitative narratives.
4. **Historical context**: At least one research topic covers historical precedents for conflict-driven market moves, with specific data points usable in trade cards.
