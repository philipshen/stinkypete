For each of the following stocks, provide: current business profile, exposure to oil price changes, Middle East revenue exposure, historical performance during past conflicts (Gulf War 1990-91, Iraq War 2003, Iran sanctions escalations, Saudi Aramco attack 2019), and specific catalysts in an Iran conflict scenario:
   - ExxonMobil (XOM)
   - Chevron (CVX)

   - SLB (formerly Schlumberger)
4. Analysis of midstream/pipeline companies that benefit from supply rerouting (Enterprise Products Partners EPD, Energy Transfer ET, Kinder Morgan KMI)
5. Oil services companies beyond HAL/SLB that could benefit (Baker Hughes BKR, TechnipFMC FTI, ChampionX CHX)
6. Downside risks: demand destruction from global recession, SPR releases, OPEC+ spare capacity response, diplomatic resolution scenarios
7. Comparison of Long vs Hedge positioning for each stock with risk/reward assessment
8. All source URLs for claims made
