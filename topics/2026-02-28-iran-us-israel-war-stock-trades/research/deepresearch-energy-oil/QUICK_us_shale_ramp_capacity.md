# Quick Research: US Shale Production Ramp Capacity

## Question
How quickly can US shale producers ramp output given current DUC (drilled but uncompleted) well inventory?

## Findings
- **DUC inventory is bifurcated by basin.** The Permian Basin exited 2025 with ~25% more DUCs than it entered with (~5,319 in May 2025), as operators banked inventory waiting for better prices. However, the Bakken and Eagle Ford saw DUCs fall 25-30% to only ~280 and ~310 respectively -- critically low levels that leave almost no buffer for rapid completions.
- **Permian completions are running ~450/month against ~425 new wells drilled**, meaning the basin is slowly drawing down its DUC backlog. Even with the elevated Permian DUC count, ramping completions materially above current rates is constrained by frac spread (hydraulic fracturing crew) availability, which remains a binding bottleneck.
- **Production is plateauing, not growing.** EIA forecasts US crude output flat-to-slightly-declining at ~13.5-13.6 million b/d through 2026. Permian output specifically is projected to decline ~245 kb/d from Nov 2025 to Dec 2026 (from 6,750 to 6,545 kb/d). The shale sector is in a structural plateau phase.
- **Emergency ramp capacity is limited and slow.** Even with elevated prices as an incentive, the timeline from decision-to-drill to first oil is 4-6 months for new wells. DUC completions can produce faster (weeks to 1-2 months), but frac crew shortages and supply chain constraints (sand, chemicals, pipe) mean the industry could realistically add only 200-400 kb/d over 6-12 months under a wartime mobilization scenario -- far less than the 1-2 million b/d swing capacity it had in 2014-2019.
- **Capital discipline further limits response.** Post-2020 shale operators have committed to shareholder returns over production growth. Major E&Ps (Pioneer/Exxon, Diamondback, Devon) have signaled they will not chase production volume even at $90+ WTI. This cultural shift means the price signal alone won't unlock rapid supply response the way it did in prior cycles.
