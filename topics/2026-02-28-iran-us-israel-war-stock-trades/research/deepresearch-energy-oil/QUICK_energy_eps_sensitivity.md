# Quick Research: Energy Stock EPS Sensitivity to Oil Prices

## Question
Quantify EPS impact per $10/bbl oil price change for XOM, CVX, COP, HAL, SLB to calibrate risk/reward in trade cards.

## Findings
This question was escalated to deep research and fully resolved. See the complete analysis at [deepresearch-energy-eps-sensitivity/SUMMARY.md](../deepresearch-energy-eps-sensitivity/SUMMARY.md).

Key results: XOM ~$0.75-1.50/share, CVX ~$1.00-2.75/share, COP ~$2.00-3.00/share per $10/bbl. OFS names (HAL, SLB) lag by 6-12 months. Midstream (KMI, EPD, ET) have negligible price sensitivity.
