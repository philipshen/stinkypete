# Quick Research: War Risk Insurance Surcharges for VLCCs in Persian Gulf

## Question
What are the real-time War Risk Insurance surcharges for VLCCs entering the Persian Gulf?

## Key Findings

### Current Premium Levels (February 2026)
- **Base war risk premiums:** Risen from ~0.125% to 0.2-0.4% of hull & machinery (H&M) value for Gulf-transiting vessels
- **Israel/US-affiliated vessels:** Quotes as high as 0.7% of H&M value
- **Broader Middle East Gulf:** Premiums climbed from 0.2-0.3% to 0.5%
- **Per-voyage cost impact:** Additional $200,000-$360,000 per VLCC voyage

### Cost Pass-Through Mechanism
- War risk insurance surcharges are passed through to charterers (oil buyers), NOT absorbed by tanker owners
- This effectively **increases tanker owner revenues** as charterers pay the premium
- FRO, STNG, INSW, DHT all benefit from surcharge pass-through

### Market Activity Context
- Middle East crude exports in February exceeded 19 million bpd (highest since April 2020)
- VLCC hiring costs tripled from start of 2026 to $170,000/day
- ME-China VLCC spot rates surged 154% in the week following military intervention
- Several major oil companies have implemented formal suspension policies for Hormuz shipments post-Feb 28 strikes

### Historical Comparison
- Red Sea/Houthi crisis (2023-24): War risk premiums reached 0.5-1.0% for Red Sea transit
- Current Hormuz premiums still below Red Sea peak but rising rapidly
- Full Hormuz closure would likely see premiums spike to 1-2%+ (similar to Arabian Gulf during Iran-Iraq Tanker War 1984-88)

### Implication for Trade Cards
War risk insurance data confirms the tanker trade thesis. Higher premiums are revenue-positive for tanker owners (pass-through) while being cost-negative for oil importers. This strengthens the FRO/STNG/DHT/INSW long thesis and the INDA/TUR short thesis (oil import cost inflation).
