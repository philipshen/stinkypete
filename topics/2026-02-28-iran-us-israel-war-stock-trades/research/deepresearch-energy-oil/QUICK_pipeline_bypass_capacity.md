# Quick Research: Saudi East-West Pipeline & UAE ADCOP Bypass Capacity

## Question
What is the current operational throughput of Saudi Arabia's East-West Pipeline (to Yanbu) and the ADCOP pipeline (to Fujairah)? Can they realistically bypass a Hormuz blockade?

## Key Findings

### Saudi East-West Pipeline (Petroline)
- **Nameplate capacity:** 5 million bpd (built 1981, expanded 1992)
- **Current throughput:** ~2 million bpd (estimated utilization ~40%)
- **Spare capacity:** ~3 million bpd theoretically available
- **Expansion plans:** Saudi Aramco targeting 6.2 million bpd capacity increase (timeline unclear)
- **Endpoint:** Yanbu port on the Red Sea

### UAE ADCOP Pipeline (Habshan-Fujairah)
- **Current capacity:** 1.5 million bpd
- **Current throughput:** Carries over half of UAE's daily crude exports
- **Expansion plans:** Capacity boost to 1.8 million bpd underway; additional 1.5 million bpd Jebel Dhanna-Fujairah pipeline planned by 2027
- **Endpoint:** Fujairah on the Gulf of Oman (bypasses Hormuz entirely)

### Combined Bypass Assessment
- **Current combined capacity:** ~6.5 million bpd (5M Saudi + 1.5M UAE)
- **Current combined throughput:** ~3.5 million bpd
- **Available spare bypass capacity:** ~3 million bpd
- **Hormuz throughput:** ~20-21 million bpd
- **Bypass covers only ~15-30% of Hormuz volumes** -- grossly insufficient to replace full closure
- **Critical limitation:** Saudi spare capacity is crude-only; does not address LNG, refined products, or condensate that also transit Hormuz
- **Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar have NO bypass options** -- their production is entirely Hormuz-dependent

### Implication for Trade Cards
Pipeline bypass capacity is a mitigating factor but NOT a substitute for Hormuz. Even at maximum theoretical throughput (6.5M bpd), only Saudi Arabia and UAE could partially bypass. This supports the $120-150/bbl scenario (partial disruption) rather than full mitigation. The energy trade cards should note bypass capacity as a downside limiter (preventing worst-case $200+/bbl from sustaining indefinitely) but not as a resolution mechanism.
