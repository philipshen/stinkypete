# Summary: Energy & Oil Plays

## Abstract

A potential Iran-US/Israel military conflict centered on the Strait of Hormuz represents the highest-impact scenario for global energy markets, with oil price projections ranging from $90-110/bbl (harassment/fear premium) to $150-200+/bbl (full closure). Historical precedents from the Gulf War (100% price spike), Iraq War (50% spike), and Saudi Aramco Abqaiq attack (19.5% intraday spike) show a consistent "spike and fade" pattern, where prices surge on fear but revert once military superiority secures export routes. Among energy stocks, ExxonMobil (XOM) emerges as the premier "safe haven" with Americas-based production insulated from conflict zones, while Chevron (CVX) carries idiosyncratic risk from its Israeli offshore gas operations (Leviathan/Tamar). Halliburton (HAL) is the best oilfield services hedge due to its North American drilling dominance, whereas SLB carries high Middle East revenue exposure making it a double-edged trade. Midstream names like Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Enterprise Products (EPD) benefit from U.S. export maximization.

## Key Insights

- **Strait of Hormuz is the critical chokepoint**: ~20-21 million bpd of crude/condensate (20% of global consumption) and 20% of global LNG trade transit through this 21-mile channel [Source: theblueprintbrief.com, gulfnews.com]
- **Three-tier price scenario framework**: Scenario 1 (harassment/fear premium) targets $90-110/bbl; Scenario 2 (temporary blockade, 2-5M bpd disruption) targets $120-150/bbl; Scenario 3 (full closure, 15-20M bpd loss) targets $150-200+/bbl [Source: discoveryalert.com.au, substack.com (Long Yield)]
- **Historical "spike and fade" pattern**: Gulf War 1990 saw 100% price surge ($17 to $40/bbl) that crashed 31.2% once coalition air campaign began; Abqaiq 2019 saw 19.5% intraday spike that fully retraced within 14 days [Source: thecloser.fm, atlantis-press.com, lnrg.technology]
- **XOM is the fortress play**: Largest US major with growth engines in Permian Basin and Guyana; exited Iraq's West Qurna 1 in 2024, reducing direct Middle East exposure; Americas production becomes world's most valuable "safe" barrels during Hormuz disruption [Source: theenergyyear.com, morningstar.com, exxonmobil.com]
- **CVX carries Israeli operational risk**: Operates massive Leviathan and Tamar gas fields offshore Israel; Israel ordered Leviathan shutdown during June 2025 conflict escalation, creating specific idiosyncratic risk [Source: naturalgasintel.com, worldoil.com]
- **COP has Qatar exposure double-edge**: Key partner in QatarEnergy's North Field expansion projects, but Qatari LNG exports transit the Strait of Hormuz; equity barrels could be physically stranded in a closure scenario [Source: euro-petrole.com, spglobal.com]
- **HAL is the best services hedge**: ~40-45% North American revenue; if Middle East supply is disrupted, U.S. shale ramps activity and HAL is the dominant fracker [Source: halliburton.com, foundations of energy analysis]
- **SLB is high-beta both ways**: Most international of large service firms with significant Middle East & Asia revenue; benefits in tension/price rise scenarios but suffers disproportionately if physical conflict halts Gulf operations; recently acquired ChampionX (July 2025) [Source: slb.com, rigzone.com]
- **BKR has LNG technology moat**: Dominant supplier of LNG liquefaction technology; even if Qatari exports pause, global scramble for LNG security drives equipment orders in US/Africa/Australia [Source: bakerhughes.com]
- **TechnipFMC (FTI) is the offshore safe play**: $16.6B subsea backlog driven by Brazil (Petrobras) and Guyana (Exxon); insulated from Middle East land wars; high oil prices incentivize deepwater in "safe" jurisdictions [Source: technipfmc.com, rivieramm.com]
- **KMI is the midstream feedgas king**: Moves ~40% of U.S. natural gas; pipelines feeding LNG export terminals become critical infrastructure as exports surge to replace lost Middle Eastern gas [Source: monexa.ai, compressortech2.com]
- **SPR is depleted**: U.S. SPR holds ~415 million barrels (58% full); coordinated IEA release could temporarily cap prices but cannot sustain long-term supply offset [Source: rigzone.com, investing.com]
- **OPEC+ spare capacity could be stranded**: Saudi Arabia and UAE hold ~3-4M bpd spare capacity, but if the Strait closes, this capacity is trapped inside the Gulf [Source: csis.org]
- **Demand destruction risk**: Oil spike to $150/bbl would likely trigger global recession (>75% probability), eventually crashing demand -- similar to 2008 pattern where oil hit $147 then crashed to $30 [Source: Long Yield analysis]

## Open Questions

### What is the current operational throughput of Saudi Arabia's East-West Pipeline (to Yanbu) and the ADCOP pipeline (to Fujairah)?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
Can they realistically bypass a Hormuz blockade, or are they already at capacity?
East-West Pipeline: 5M bpd capacity, ~2M bpd current throughput (~3M bpd spare). ADCOP: 1.5M bpd capacity, expanding to 1.8M bpd. Combined bypass capacity ~6.5M bpd vs ~20M bpd through Hormuz -- covers only 15-30% of volumes. Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar have NO bypass. Supports $120-150/bbl partial disruption scenario. See [details](./QUICK_pipeline_bypass_capacity.md).

### What are the real-time War Risk Insurance surcharges for VLCCs entering the Persian Gulf?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
This is a leading indicator of actual shipping disruptions.
Premiums rose from ~0.125% to 0.2-0.4% of H&M value (0.7% for US/Israel-affiliated vessels). Per-voyage VLCC cost impact: $200K-$360K. Surcharges are passed through to charterers, effectively boosting tanker owner revenues. ME crude exports in Feb exceeded 19M bpd despite elevated premiums. See [details](./QUICK_war_risk_insurance.md).

### How would China respond to a Hormuz closure given it imports the majority of Iranian oil?
**Status:** Filtered
Would China pressure Iran to keep the Strait open or seek alternative supply arrangements?
Speculative/unknowable -- Chinese geopolitical response cannot be predicted. Tangential to individual trade card format.

### What is the EPS sensitivity per $10/bbl oil price change for major energy stocks?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
XOM ~$0.75-1.50, CVX ~$1.00-2.75, COP ~$2.00-3.00. OFS names lag 6-12 months. Midstream negligible. Full deep research completed. See [details](./QUICK_energy_eps_sensitivity.md) and [full analysis](../deepresearch-energy-eps-sensitivity/SUMMARY.md).

### How much additional US shale production can realistically be brought online during a supply disruption?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
Severely limited vs prior cycles. Permian has ~5,300 DUCs but frac spread availability is the binding constraint. Bakken/Eagle Ford DUCs at critically low levels (~280-310). Realistically only 200-400 kb/d addable over 6-12 months -- far less than the 1-2 mb/d swing of 2014-2019. See [details](./QUICK_us_shale_ramp_capacity.md).
