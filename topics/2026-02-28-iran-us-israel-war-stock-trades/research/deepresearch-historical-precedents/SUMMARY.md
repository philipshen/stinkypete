# Summary: Historical Precedents & Market Patterns

## Abstract

Analysis of market behavior during the Gulf War (1990-91), Iraq War (2003), Soleimani Strike (2020), and Israel-Hamas conflict (2023) reveals a consistent "buy the invasion" pattern: markets bottom during the period of maximum uncertainty before or at the onset of kinetic operations, then rally as the conflict timeline becomes "known." The S&P 500 rallied 18-20% during Desert Storm after bottoming in October 1990, and gained 26.7% in the 12 months following the 2003 Iraq invasion. Defense stocks (LMT, NOC, GD) generate reliable alpha on Day 1 of conflict (5-11% gap-ups), with NOC and LMT as the most consistent outperformers. Energy stocks spike on initial shock but historically fade once supply disruption fears are bounded -- oil prices fell 21-31% once coalition air campaigns began in both 1991 and 2003. Gold spikes as a safe haven but sustains gains only in prolonged conflicts that threaten currency debasement. Cybersecurity is a "modern war" play relevant only since 2020, with PANW and ZS showing the strongest conflict-driven returns. The key insight for the current Iran-US/Israel conflict: if this is a short punitive strike (like Soleimani 2020), expect full market recovery within weeks; if it escalates to a prolonged campaign involving Hormuz disruption, the Gulf War 1990 pattern (6-month drawdown before rally) is the closest analog.

## Key Insights

- **"Buy the Invasion" Pattern Is Robust**: In every major conflict since 1990, the S&P 500 bottomed before or on the day combat operations began. Gulf War: bottomed October 1990, rallied when Desert Storm began January 1991. Iraq War: bottomed March 11, 2003, nine days before the invasion. Markets price worst-case scenarios during buildup and remove risk premium once the timeline becomes "known." [Source: Forbes, CBS News, FTPortfolios]

- **Sector Rotation Follows a Predictable 3-Phase Pattern**: Phase 1 (Day 0-3): Defense and energy outperform while airlines and consumer discretionary dump. Phase 2 (Week 1-4): Energy peaks and rolls over; defense holds gains but momentum slows. Phase 3 (Month 1+): Tech and broad equities lead the recovery. [Source: Investing.com, Seeking Alpha]

- **Defense Stocks Are the Most Reliable Conflict Trade**: LMT, NOC, and GD consistently gap up 5-11% on Day 1 of conflict. The October 9, 2023 Hamas reaction was the strongest in recent history: NOC +11.4%, LMT +8.9%, GD +8.4%. Boeing consistently underperforms due to commercial aviation exposure. Sustained outperformance (12+ months) requires protracted conflict -- Israel-Hamas delivered RTX +82.7% and LMT +54.9% over 12 months. [Source: AOAV, DR Wealth, LA Times]

- **Oil Prices Follow "Spike and Fade" Unless Physical Infrastructure Is Destroyed**: Gulf War 1990 saw a 90% WTI surge ($21 to $40) that crashed 30% when the air campaign began. Iraq 2003 saw oil fall 21% post-invasion. Soleimani 2020 saw a 4% intraday spike that erased within 5 days. Israel-Hamas 2023 saw oil rise 4% then trend lower over 3 months. Historical pattern: shorting oil spikes post-invasion is high-probability unless physical supply infrastructure (pipelines/Strait of Hormuz) is destroyed. [Source: OPEC, NPS, The Closer]

- **Gold Spikes on Rumor, Fades on Resolution**: Gulf War 1990: +15% pre-invasion, faded post-Desert Storm. Iraq 2003: peaked Feb at $388, dropped 10-15% within 30 days of invasion. Soleimani 2020: spiked to $1,550, retreated within weeks. Gold sustains gains only when conflict threatens broad economic stability or currency debasement. Short regional conflicts produce spikes that reverse in days. [Source: Gold.org, Markets.com, Sunshine Profits]

- **Cybersecurity Is a Nascent but Growing Conflict Play**: Only relevant data from 2020 and 2023. PANW shows the strongest Day 1 response (+1.5% Soleimani, +2.3% Hamas). ZS led the 2023 reaction (+4.0% Day 1, +7.5% 1-week). Platform cybersecurity stocks benefit from expectations of state-sponsored cyber retaliation. Stocks with Israeli R&D exposure (CHKP, S) initially underperform on operational risk. [Source: Seeking Alpha, Business Insider]

- **Drawdown Depth Correlates with Conflict Duration**: Soleimani 2020 (acute, no ground war): -0.7% drawdown, recovered in days. Gulf War 1990 (6-month buildup + 6-week war): -16.9% drawdown, 71 days to bottom. Pearl Harbor (prolonged existential threat): -19.8% drawdown, 143 days to bottom. The current Iran conflict's market impact depends on whether it's acute (Soleimani analog) or structural (Gulf War analog). [Source: AAII, Forbes]

- **Halliburton Outperformed Massively Post-2003 Due to Reconstruction**: HAL returned +80% in 12 months post-Iraq invasion, driven by Iraq reconstruction contracts. Energy services are a long-duration conflict play that pays off only in protracted wars with significant infrastructure rebuilding. [Source: 305Herald, historical performance data]

- **S&P 500 Returned Positive in 12 Months Following Every Conflict Since 1990**: Gulf War: +10.2%, Iraq War: +26.7%, Soleimani: +0.5% (before COVID), Hamas: +11.5% (3-month). The 2003 post-invasion rally was the strongest, coinciding with an economic recovery. [Source: NRS Foru, Unio-EB]

## Open Questions

### Is the current Iran-US/Israel conflict more analogous to the 1990 Gulf War (structural supply disruption, prolonged campaign) or the 2020 Soleimani strike (acute, rapidly contained)?
**Status:** Filtered
Analytical framing -- addressed in final synthesis. The Key Insights section already provides the framework for both analogs and their trade implications.

### Given that defense valuations are already at 22-40x P/E versus 15-20x historical averages, how much upside remains from the conflict versus what is already priced in?
**Status:** Filtered
Analytical framing -- addressed in final synthesis. Valuation analysis already covered in deepresearch-defense-aerospace (GD best value at 22.5x, RTX most stretched at 40x).

### Does the "buy the invasion" pattern hold when the conflict involves a major oil chokepoint (Strait of Hormuz) rather than a landlocked theater?
**Status:** Filtered
Analytical framing -- addressed in final synthesis. The Gulf War 1990 precedent (which involved oil supply disruption) is already analyzed in Key Insights and shows pattern held but with deeper initial drawdown.

### How does the existence of a large U.S. shale industry (absent in 1990-91) change the oil spike dynamics and duration compared to Gulf War precedents?
**Status:** Filtered
Already covered in deepresearch-energy-oil QUICK_us_shale_ramp_capacity.md. Key finding: US shale can only add 200-400 kb/d over 6-12 months, far less than needed to offset Hormuz disruption. Shale is a dampener but not a neutralizer.
