## S&P 500 Broad Market Performance During Conflicts 📈

**Gulf War (Aug 1990 – Feb 1991):** The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sparked a sharp sell-off. In the first week after Aug 2, 1990, the S&P 500 fell roughly 5–6% (the Dow plunged 3.3% in one day and was down 173 points that week) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20Dow%20Jones%20industrial%20average,Japanese%20and%20Western%20European%20markets)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20Dow%20closed%20at%202716,the%20crisis%20began%20last%20week)). The slide continued for about two months – the market ultimately bottomed in **early October 1990** (approximately ~50 trading days after the invasion) at ~20% below pre-invasion levels ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)). Once the U.S.-led coalition began bombing (Jan 17, 1991), sentiment flipped **“from fear to relief.”** Stocks surged ~4–5% **on that first day of Operation Desert Storm** ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)). The S&P then rallied throughout the 6-week war. By the time Kuwait was liberated in late Feb 1991, the index had gained about **+20% off the October lows** ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)) – essentially back to pre-invasion levels. One year from the invasion, the S&P 500 was actually modestly **higher (~+5%)** than before the crisis, thanks to the post-war rebound (and the U.S. economy coming out of recession). In short, **the market’s low point came near the start of the war**, and a powerful relief rally followed (“buy the invasion, sell the peace”). 

**Iraq War (Mar 2003 – 2004):** Equities were weak going into the Iraq invasion (the S&P was sliding in early 2003 amid looming war). But as soon as the war became inevitable, the market turned. **In the week of the U.S. invasion (March 17–24, 2003), the S&P 500 jumped about +7.5%** – its best week in months ([www.statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/sandp-500-weekly-returns-for-oct-2001-to-march-2003#:~:text=Image%3A%20sandp%20500%20weekly%20returns,oct%202001%20to%20march%202003)). On the first day of combat, stocks surged (the Dow industrials rose ~3% and the S&P similar) as the conflict’s outcome seemed favorable ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)). After one month, the Dow was up ~+8.4% ([www.hennionandwalsh.com](https://www.hennionandwalsh.com/insights/stock-market-reactions-to-war-and-terrorist-attacks-a-historical-analysis/#:~:text=prior%20weeks%20of%20decline,might%20be%20shorter%20than%20anticipated)) (high single-digit gains for the S&P as well). The **market bottom actually occurred just *before* the war started** (mid-March 2003); from that low the S&P 500 climbed roughly +15% over the next 3 months. **12 months after** the invasion, the broad market was **up ~30%** – the war marked the end of the 2000–2002 bear market and the start of a new bull run ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)). (Investors had “priced in” worst-case scenarios before the war, then bought aggressively once fighting began and a quick victory was in sight.)

**2020 U.S.–Iran Tensions (Jan 2020 Soleimani Strike):** The U.S. airstrike on Jan 3, 2020 that killed Iran’s General Soleimani caused a brief jolt of volatility. On that day, the S&P 500 slipped ~0.7% (as investors fled to oil and gold) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=,year%20high)). However, **the pullback was short-lived** – within a week, U.S. stocks had recovered to **new record highs** as immediate war fears ebbed ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/asia-primed-for-stock-rally-but-iran-worry-lingers-markets-wrap#:~:text=U,Middle%20East%20Calm%3A%20Markets%20Wrap)). The broad market was **up ~1–2% one week later**. One month after the strike (early Feb 2020), the S&P 500 was even higher (hitting fresh highs ~3–4% above the pre-strike level). In essence, the Iran-U.S. flare-up had only a *transient* impact on sentiment. By 3 months out (April 2020), any geopolitical influence was overwhelmed by the **COVID-19 pandemic crash** – the S&P plunged over 20% in March 2020 for pandemic reasons, not the Iran clash. Yet 12 months later (Jan 2021), thanks to the massive pandemic stimulus rebound, the S&P 500 had surged about **+15% above its Jan 2020 levels**. **Key point:** the Soleimani conflict premium unwound within days, making little dent in the market’s longer-term uptrend (the much larger COVID shock soon dominated). 

**2023 Hamas–Israel Conflict (Oct 7, 2023 onward):** The immediate market reaction to the Hamas terror attack on Israel was relatively muted in the U.S. The S&P 500 **opened down sharply on Oct 9, 2023** (the next trading day) but **rebounded intraday to close +0.6% higher** ([econcurrents.com](https://econcurrents.com/2023/10/09/09-oct-2023-market-close-major-financial-headlines-wall-street-main-indexes-open-sharply-lower-then-start-trending-upwards-after-discounting-many-israel-hamas-war-closing-moderately-higher-in/#:~:text=,008)). Investors quickly “discounted” the war fears, viewing the conflict as regional. Over the next week, the S&P drifted amid other concerns (rising interest rates, etc.) and by mid-October had fallen a few percent from early-October levels. Notably, the **market’s *low* came about 3 weeks after the war’s start** (late Oct 2023, the S&P ~4–5% below its early-Oct level). Thereafter, stocks rallied strongly. By one month after (early Nov 2023), the S&P had regained its losses and then some. **Three months after** the war’s start (by Jan 2024), the index was roughly **+5% above** its pre-war level, aided by falling bond yields and resilient earnings. (Because the conflict remained contained and fairly “priced in,” it did not derail the market’s broader trajectory – by year-end 2023 the S&P was up ~+18% YTD ([app.macrotrends.net](https://app.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data#:~:text=%25%20Change%20,28.88)).) Overall, the **U.S. market dipped only briefly** on the Israel-Hamas war news and **bottomed within ~20 days**, then resumed climbing once it was clear the war wouldn’t expand drastically. 

## Defense & Aerospace Sector Performance ✈️🚀

**Initial Reaction – Surge in Defense Stocks:** Geopolitical conflicts have consistently led to **outperformance by defense contractors** in the immediate aftermath. Each conflict saw a “run to defense” trade as investors anticipated higher military spending and orders:

- **Gulf War 1990–91:** Defense stocks **rose even as the broad market fell** during the crisis build-up. For example, in August 1990 while the S&P was dropping, *“the prospect of military action in the Gulf” buoyed some defense names* ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20rise%20in%20oil%20prices,defense%20industry%20stocks%20and%20gold)). Once the U.S. commenced Operation Desert Storm (Jan 17, 1991), defense and aerospace shares *exploded* upward. In the first few days of bombing Iraq, Wall Street bid up high-tech weapons-makers dramatically. Analysts noted a “euphoric” reaction to televised precision strikes ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=For%20the%20past%20six%20days%2C,miles%20away%20with%20pinpoint%20accuracy)). **Within the first week of war, major defense contractors saw double-digit gains:** e.g. General Dynamics stock **soared 37% in the first 6 days of fighting** ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)) (its tanks and combat systems were in high demand). Other primes like Raytheon, Lockheed and Martin Marietta jumped briskly as well ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). A Dow Jones aerospace/defense index leapt ~+2.3% on Jan 21, 1991 even as the broader Dow fell – reflecting investors piling into defense plays ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Marietta%20Corp,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). **Day 1:** When the war started, many defense names popped 5–10%+ immediately. **1-week:** The sector was **up 20–30%+** in aggregate over the first week of Desert Storm. However, these war-driven spikes *did not last indefinitely* (see below). Once Iraq’s defeat seemed certain and talk of peace grew, defense stocks’ momentum cooled. (Notably, the 1991 Gulf War was followed by a post-Cold War budget drawdown, which eventually tempered the defense sector’s gains.)

- **Iraq War 2003:** Defense contractors had already been strong prior to the Iraq invasion (U.S. defense budgets were climbing after 9/11). Even so, they got an extra **bump when the war began in March 2003**. Stocks like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and General Dynamics all rose on the invasion news. The rally was **more modest** than 1991’s, but clearly positive: defense stocks gained a few percent on the invasion day and outperformed the S&P 500 during the first month of the war. (One analysis noted these names were near multi-year highs going into the conflict, so their upside was somewhat priced in.) For example, **the week of the invasion**, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Lockheed, etc. climbed roughly **+5–10%** as a group (while the broad market also rose) ([www.hennionandwalsh.com](https://www.hennionandwalsh.com/insights/stock-market-reactions-to-war-and-terrorist-attacks-a-historical-analysis/#:~:text=prior%20weeks%20of%20decline,might%20be%20shorter%20than%20anticipated)). **By 1-month after** (April 2003), defense stocks had leveled off – the quick U.S. victory meant no massive surge in new orders yet. Over the **12 months following**, however, the sector did very well *in absolute terms* (supported by the broader bull market and sustained military operations in Iraq). Notably, through 2004–2007 the **Defense/Aerospace sector enjoyed a multi-year run-up**, outperforming the S&P as U.S. defense spending stayed high. In summary, **initial war pop:** +5–10% in first weeks; **longer-term:** continued strength as conflict led to real contracts (e.g. sustained outperformance through 2004+). 

- **Jan 2020 Iran Tensions:** The U.S.-Iran flare-up over Soleimani’s killing caused a swift jump in defense stocks for a few days. On Jan 3, 2020 (the day of the drone strike), **defense contractors spiked**: Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, L3Harris, etc. all shot up at the open. Northrop in particular saw its **biggest one-day surge in 5 months** ([www.thestreet.com](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/aerospace-and-defense-stocks-climb-following-iran-counterattack#:~:text=The%20aerospace%20and%20defense%20group,biggest%20surge%20in%20five%20months)). By the next trading day (Mon Jan 6), defense-oriented ETFs and stocks remained strong – investors speculated on retaliatory conflict. For instance, *Northrop Grumman (NOC) jumped ~5%* and Lockheed ~3% in the sessions immediately after the strike (an index of defense stocks rose ~1.2% that day) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/usiran-tension-calls-for-investing-in-cybersecurity-stocks-200496962#:~:text=Evidently%2C%20the%20ETFMG%20Prime%20Cyber,after%20Iran%20threatened%20to%20retaliate)). **However, the rally was short-lived:** when it became clear Iran’s response would be limited (by Jan 8, 2020), these stocks **pulled back**. TheStreet noted defense shares **“soared” after the Jan 3 strike, but then **receded** as tensions de-escalated ([www.thestreet.com](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/aerospace-and-defense-stocks-climb-following-iran-counterattack#:~:text=Shares%20of%20aerospace,as%20markets%20digested%20the%20news)) ([www.thestreet.com](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/aerospace-and-defense-stocks-climb-following-iran-counterattack#:~:text=Both%20had%20receded%20somewhat%20when,in%20tensions%20on%20both%20sides)). By one week later, much of the initial spike had faded. **1-month later (Feb 2020):** most defense names were roughly back to their pre-crisis levels as the Iran conflict fears subsided (and other factors took over). In summary: **Day 1:** big jump (Northrop +5% day-of, etc.), **1-week:** up low-single-digits overall after giving back gains, **1-month:** essentially round-trip to baseline. *(Soon after, the COVID shock in March hit all stocks, including defense, which then overshadowed any geopolitical effects.)*

- **Oct 2023 Hamas–Israel War:** The Israel–Gaza war ignited a **notable “arms maker rally”** especially in the first few weeks. On Monday Oct 9, 2023, U.S. defense stocks skyrocketed at the open on news of war in the Middle East. **Day 1 reaction:** Lockheed Martin (LMT) jumped **+8.9%** and Northrop Grumman (NOC) rocketed **+11.4%** in a single day (Oct 9) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%2C%20a%20major,on%20October%209th%5B1)) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=This%20surge%20in%20Lockheed%20Martin%E2%80%99s,2)). RTX (Raytheon Technologies) climbed about +4.6% that day ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=This%20surge%20in%20Lockheed%20Martin%E2%80%99s,2)), and General Dynamics (GD) nearly +10% ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=and%20aerospace%20stocks%20have%20demonstrated,near%20its%20lowest%20level%20since)). This was the **biggest one-day move for U.S. defense contractors since the March 2020 COVID crash recovery** ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%2C%20a%20major,on%20October%209th%5B1)) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=These%20sharp%20movements%20in%20stock,largest%20defence%20contractor)). The surge reflected expectations that Israel and Western militaries would urgently need more missiles, rockets, and defense systems. **Over the next 1–2 weeks**, defense stocks **held onto** most of those gains. By late October, LMT was **+12%** vs. pre-war levels (helped partly by a strong earnings report) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=and%20aerospace%20stocks%20have%20demonstrated,near%20its%20lowest%20level%20since)), and RTX was ~+5% over the month ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20witnessed%20an%20impressive,near%20its%20lowest%20level%20since)). However, as the conflict remained regional and did not escalate into a wider war, the defense rally **stalled in November**. Investors took profits, and some defense names retreated from their October highs. (For example, by December many had drifted down a few percent from the peak as the initial “war trade” cooled.) **3-months out (Jan 2024):** the aerospace/defense index was still up on net (several percent higher than pre-conflict), but off the early highs as focus shifted back to normal procurement cycles. **Key point:** defense stocks *outperformed dramatically at conflict onset* (Hamas war Day 1 gave multi-month highs for LMT/NOC ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%2C%20a%20major,on%20October%209th%5B1))) and generally **beat the broader market** over the conflict’s first month. But unless the war drives prolonged increases in military spending, these spikes tend to level off. 

**Winners vs. Laggards:** In each conflict, certain defense names led the pack. Generally, contractors with products immediately relevant to the conflict saw the biggest boosts. For example, during Desert Storm in 1991, **high-tech weapons makers** were top gainers – e.g. Raytheon (Patriot missiles), Martin Marietta and Lockheed (precision-guided munitions) were bid up as TV footage showed their systems’ effectiveness ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=For%20the%20past%20six%20days%2C,miles%20away%20with%20pinpoint%20accuracy)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). Analysts noted an “emotional” rush into these stocks as the war unfolded ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). By contrast, companies perceived as less directly involved or with longer project cycles saw smaller moves. In the 2023 case, *pure-play defense* firms (missiles, jets) like Northrop, Lockheed, General Dynamics outperformed, while diversified aerospace companies or those facing other headwinds didn’t jump as much (RTX, which had been near 52-week lows pre-war, rose ~5% but also was weighed by its civil aviation business) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=and%20aerospace%20stocks%20have%20demonstrated,near%20its%20lowest%20level%20since)). Overall, **all major defense primes tended to outperform the market during these conflicts**, but the **magnitude** varied – often **Northrop Grumman, Lockheed, and General Dynamics led** the pack in U.S. conflicts, while second-tier or commercial-heavy names lagged slightly. 

**Performance Summary (Day 1 through 12 Months):** To summarize with a few examples: on **Day 1** of recent conflicts, defense stocks often jump **+5% to +10%** (or more) instantly ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=This%20surge%20in%20Lockheed%20Martin%E2%80%99s,2)) ([www.thestreet.com](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/aerospace-and-defense-stocks-climb-following-iran-counterattack#:~:text=The%20aerospace%20and%20defense%20group,biggest%20surge%20in%20five%20months)). Within **1 week**, they can hold high single-digit gains (Gulf War example: defense index up ~15%+ in a week, far outpacing the market ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began))). After **1 month**, the sector is usually still up (low double-digit % above pre-conflict) unless tensions abate very quickly. Over **3 months**, performance diverges – if the conflict is ongoing or has broadened, defense stocks can keep rising; if it’s resolved quickly, they might revert. For instance, after the brief Iran scare in 2020, defense plays were *flat to down* a few months later (no war happened). After the 2003 Iraq invasion, defense stocks were **higher 3 and 12 months later** (benefiting from the sustained military campaign). After the 1991 Gulf War (quick victory), defense stocks initially spiked but then leveled off later in 1991 as peace cut future orders. **Outperformance vs S&P:** In essentially all cases, defense/aerospace stocks *outperformed the S&P 500* during the conflict’s initial phase. The degree ranged from modest (a few % in 2003) to huge (dozens of % in 1991) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). 

## Energy & Oil Sector Performance 🛢️🔥

**Oil Price Spikes and Reversals:** Middle East conflicts typically cause **oil prices to spike sharply** on supply fears – but these spikes have often been **short-lived**. Historical precedents show a clear pattern:

- During the **1990 Gulf crisis**, crude oil roughly **doubled** in price in the run-up. In July 1990, prior to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, WTI crude was ~$19/barrel; by October 1990, as the crisis deepened, oil hit about **$40/barrel** (an over **+100%** surge) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=It%20is%20important%20to%20understand,to%20over%20%2440%20by%20October)). This price shock pushed global oil to its highest levels since the 1970s. However, the spike didn’t last – once the U.S.-led offensive began in January 1991, oil **plunged**. Investors had priced in worst-case supply disruptions that never fully materialized. In fact, on rumors of a possible peaceful resolution in mid-October 1990, oil had already started falling from its peak (dropping back below $40) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/10/13/dow-stages-32-point-rebound/7ba96983-a276-4724-b67e-cfec857129c9/?isMobile=1#:~:text=Unconfirmed%20reports%20that%20Iraq%20may,69%20a%20barrel)). And **when Operation Desert Storm launched in Jan ’91, crude experienced a “collapse” in prices** ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)). By March 1991 (ceasefire), oil was back near **$20–$22** – essentially round-tripping to pre-invasion levels. **Takeaway:** about a 3-month spike up, then a very fast reversal once war actually broke out.

- In the **2003 Iraq War**, a similar dynamic played out on a smaller scale. Oil had been climbing in late 2002 and early 2003 as war appeared likely. By early March 2003, Brent crude reached the high $30s (around $34–$37, a ~30–40% rise from the prior autumn) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=New%20York%20crude%20oil%20futures,growing%20threat%20of%20military%20conflict)). But as soon as the U.S. invasion began, traders anticipated a quick victory and **the “war premium” in oil evaporated**. In fact, the 1991 Gulf War was cited as precedent: *“the launch of Desert Storm was the cue for... a collapse in the price of crude”* ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)). Indeed, in March–April 2003, oil prices fell hard. Brent crude, which had traded above $30, dropped into the low $20s by late April 2003 (a decline of ~–30% or more). The feared supply disruptions didn’t materialize (Iraq’s oil facilities were secured quickly), so **within ~4–6 weeks of the invasion, oil had given up the entire pre-war gain**. By 3 months after (summer 2003), crude was actually *lower* than before the war. **However**, it’s worth noting that a longer-term uptrend in oil began in mid-2003 (due to global recovery and other factors) – so 12 months after the invasion, oil was climbing again, but that was more about global demand than the war itself.

- In the **Jan 2020 U.S.–Iran confrontation**, oil reacted immediately but briefly. Brent crude **spiked to ~$70** per barrel in the days following the Jan 3 Soleimani strike – its highest level in about 4 months ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=,year%20high)). This was roughly a +5% jump (U.S. WTI crude also jumped into the mid-$60s). Energy traders feared an escalated U.S.–Iran conflict could threaten Persian Gulf oil shipments. But the tension de-escalated within days, and the spike quickly reversed. By **one week later**, crude had fallen back below pre-crisis levels – **“back below $60”** as calm returned ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/asia-primed-for-stock-rally-but-iran-worry-lingers-markets-wrap#:~:text=U,Middle%20East%20Calm%3A%20Markets%20Wrap)). In other words, the oil price surge lasted mere days. Anyone who “bought” oil on the Iran war fear had only a very narrow window before it plunged. (Notably, other forces then took over: by late January, oil was sliding on coronavirus demand concerns, *unrelated* to geopolitics.)

- In the **Oct 2023 Israel–Hamas war**, oil again jumped initially. On Oct 9, the first trading day after the attacks, WTI crude surged about **+$3.5 (+4%) to ~$86** ([econcurrents.com](https://econcurrents.com/2023/10/09/09-oct-2023-market-close-major-financial-headlines-wall-street-main-indexes-open-sharply-lower-then-start-trending-upwards-after-discounting-many-israel-hamas-war-closing-moderately-higher-in/#:~:text=,up%200.079%20points)), and Brent likewise rose ~4–5% (into the high $80s). This reflected worries that a wider regional war (especially involving Iran) might disrupt Middle East oil exports. However, absent direct Iranian involvement, those fears eased. By late October, oil prices had **retreated**; Brent, which briefly neared $90+, sank back to the low $80s within a month. In fact, by mid-November 2023, Brent fell below where it was before Oct 7. So the **oil spike lasted only a few weeks** before reversing. *Summary:* Middle East conflicts produce a short-term oil rally, but unless the conflict spreads to major oil producers or shipping lanes, the price gains tend to unwind relatively quickly (within weeks or a few months). 

**Energy Stock Performance (XOM, CVX, COP, HAL, SLB, etc):** Oil & gas equities mirror the above pattern – **sharp initial gains followed by retracement** if the oil spike is short-lived:

- **1990–91 (Gulf War):** Integrated oil majors and oil-service stocks jumped when oil prices shot up in 1990. For instance, as oil spiked on Iraq’s invasion, *“oil company shares [were] rallying”* – Exxon and Chevron shares **rose** on those days even as the broad market fell ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20rise%20in%20oil%20prices,defense%20industry%20stocks%20and%20gold)). In early August ’90, Exxon was up +2% and Chevron +0.8% on a day the Dow plunged ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20Dow%20closed%20at%202716,the%20crisis%20began%20last%20week)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20rise%20in%20oil%20prices,defense%20industry%20stocks%20and%20gold)). Over the next month, energy stocks significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (benefiting from surging crude prices). **However,** once oil peaked in Oct 1990 and started dropping, the wind came out of the sector. By the time the war began in January and oil collapsed, energy stocks gave back gains. Many oil companies actually underperformed in 1991 as oil prices normalized. *One-year view:* an investor who chased oil stocks at the height of the crisis (Fall 1990) would have seen those stocks decline once the war ended and oil prices fell. But someone who bought energy stocks *before* the invasion and sold into the oil spike could have locked in strong short-term profits.

- **2003 (Iraq War):** Leading up to March 2003, energy stocks (ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, etc.) rose moderately thanks to higher oil prices. But when oil flipped direction at war onset, energy stocks also **pulled back.** The quick victory in Iraq meant no sustained disruption to supply – in fact, oil supply increased later – so oil producers’ stocks underperformed once the war started. Many oil & gas equities were flat-to-down in the 1–3 months after the invasion (even as the broad market rallied), reflecting the drop in crude prices. By 12 months after, though, a new oil uptrend (driven by global growth and OPEC cuts) lifted energy stocks again. **Key pattern:** buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news – energy shares tended to rise into the conflict and then dip once actual fighting commenced and oil prices fell. 

- **Jan 2020 (Iran tensions):** Energy stocks saw a *very brief* pop. In the days after the Soleimani strike, oil majors and drillers jumped alongside oil. For example, in Europe BP rose +1.9% and Shell +1.3% on Jan 6, 2020 ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=The%20winners%3A%20Oil%20companies%20and,weapons%20makers)); similarly, U.S. giants like ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) were higher by a few percent. Oilfield service firms like Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) also got a short-lived boost on expectations of higher oil prices or Middle East turmoil. Yet as noted, crude prices retreated within a week – and energy stocks **quickly gave up their gains.** By mid-January 2020, the S&P Energy sector was roughly flat again and then started falling as the COVID-19 outbreak hit oil demand. **In sum:** Day-1 and week-1 saw energy names up a few percent (in line with oil’s ~5% jump) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=,year%20high)), but one month later they were down, caught in the broader sell-off. This episode illustrated how *ephemeral* war-driven rallies in oil equities can be if the conflict doesn’t escalate.

- **Oct 2023 (Israel–Hamas war):** Energy stocks initially rallied on the news of war. On Oct 9, 2023, as oil jumped ~4%, big U.S. oil companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron saw their shares climb on the order of +3% intraday (and European oil firms BP/Shell were up similarly) as traders bet on higher oil prices. Refiners and oil-services also rose. But as with prior cases, the gains didn’t last long. Within a few weeks, oil prices fell back, and energy equities lagged. By November 2023, the Energy sector had **declined** amid falling crude and pessimism about demand. Notably, late 2023 saw oil prices pressured by global economic concerns, so energy stocks gave back all the war-premium and then some. **Performance timeline:** Day 1: XOM, CVX up ~+3%; **1-week:** still up slightly as oil remained elevated; **1-month:** down as oil retraced; **3-month:** sector underperformed the market (since by early 2024 oil was below pre-war levels). 

**How Quickly the Oil Spike Unwinds:** In these precedents, the **timing** of oil’s reversal is noteworthy. In 1990, oil’s peak came ~2.5 months after the invasion (Oct 1990) and then prices fell for the next 4–5 months, *especially rapidly* once the shooting war began ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)). In 2003, the peak was basically just before the war (early March) and the drop occurred within weeks (by April, oil was much lower) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=New%20York%20crude%20oil%20futures,growing%20threat%20of%20military%20conflict)). In 2020, the spike and reversal all happened within ~7 days ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/asia-primed-for-stock-rally-but-iran-worry-lingers-markets-wrap#:~:text=U,Middle%20East%20Calm%3A%20Markets%20Wrap)). In 2023, it was on the order of 2–4 weeks. So **modern markets tend to correct war-driven oil jumps faster**, likely due to more efficient pricing and the fact that strategic reserves and spare capacity can offset short-term disruptions. For traders, this implies that **energy trades must be timed very well** – the window to profit from a war-related oil surge is often short. “**Sell the rip**” quickly is usually the play, as by the time peace or de-escalation arrives, oil often **plummets**, catching latecomers off guard. 

**Energy Sector Returns Summary:** Across these conflicts, **oil producers’ stocks (e.g. Exxon, Chevron, Occidental, Conoco)** typically had **positive one-day and one-week returns** following the outbreak of hostilities (roughly on the order of +2% to +5%), proportional to the oil price jump ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1990/08/07/markets-take-worst-hit-yet-on-gulf-uncertainty/03d0d695-7e51-4841-ac03-ed291e2fbf78/#:~:text=The%20rise%20in%20oil%20prices,defense%20industry%20stocks%20and%20gold)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=The%20winners%3A%20Oil%20companies%20and,weapons%20makers)). Oilfield service and drilling stocks (Schlumberger, Halliburton, etc.) saw similar short-term bumps. **One month later**, the sector’s performance diverged depending on oil: often those initial gains washed out if oil prices normalized (as seen in 1991, 2003, 2023). **Three to 12 months later**, energy stock performance was driven by broader supply/demand trends. For example, 12 months after the 1991 Gulf War, oil stocks were down from pre-war due to collapsing oil prices. 12 months after the 2003 invasion, they were up, but largely because oil started a secular uptrend later in 2003 (China growth, etc.), not the war itself. The key insight is that **a war-driven oil rally tends to be a “spike and fade”** – great for a tactical trade, but not a sustainable driver unless the conflict fundamentally constrains supply. 

## Cybersecurity Sector Performance 🔒💻

Modern conflicts now include the cyber realm, and investors have started treating **cybersecurity stocks** as a defensive play during geopolitical flare-ups involving Iran or other hacking threats. We have two recent precedents:

**2020 Iran Cyber Tensions:** After the Soleimani strike in Jan 2020, experts warned of potential Iranian cyber retaliation. This led to a burst of interest in cybersecurity companies. **On the first trading day** following the strike, shares of prominent cyber firms **spiked:** *CrowdStrike (CRWD) surged as much as +11% intraday on Jan 6, 2020* ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/cybersecurity-stocks-gain-as-iran-risk-could-bolster-demand-k52sckvo#:~:text=Shares%20of%20cybersecurity%20companies%20gained,will%20result%20in%20more%20business)) (closing about +8–9% up ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/usiran-tension-calls-for-investing-in-cybersecurity-stocks-200496962#:~:text=Evidently%2C%20the%20ETFMG%20Prime%20Cyber,after%20Iran%20threatened%20to%20retaliate))), adding to gains from the previous session. FireEye (FEYE) jumped ~5% over two days ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/cybersecurity-stocks-gain-as-iran-risk-could-bolster-demand-k52sckvo#:~:text=Shares%20of%20cybersecurity%20companies%20gained,will%20result%20in%20more%20business)). Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) also rallied mid-single-digits. An index of cybersecurity companies (ETFMG HACK ETF) rose +1.2% that day and about +3.4% over the week ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/usiran-tension-calls-for-investing-in-cybersecurity-stocks-200496962#:~:text=Evidently%2C%20the%20ETFMG%20Prime%20Cyber,after%20Iran%20threatened%20to%20retaliate)). This strength was driven by expectations that companies and governments would ramp up security spending if Iran launched cyberattacks. **Short-term returns:** many cyber stocks were **up ~5–10% in the first week** of January 2020. **One month later,** however, those gains largely dissipated. As the U.S.-Iran conflict did not escalate into a significant cyber war (and broader market factors took over), cybersecurity stocks gave back their pop. Notably, CrowdStrike and Palo Alto, which had jumped ~6% and ~12% in the 10 trading days after the incident, **surrendered those gains shortly thereafter** ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/crowdstrike-eyes-breakout-as-cyber-threats-boost-demand/#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20that,the%20immediate%20threat%20was%20over)). Both stocks traded back down once the immediate threat was perceived to be over ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/crowdstrike-eyes-breakout-as-cyber-threats-boost-demand/#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20that,the%20immediate%20threat%20was%20over)). By three months out (April 2020), the entire market was in a COVID-driven downturn, and the cyber names were no exception (they fell in March, then rebounded by April). **Key pattern:** a quick “cyber spike” on conflict news, followed by a mean reversion if the feared cyberattacks don’t materialize. Traders who bought the initial rumor needed to exit within weeks to lock profits. 

**2023 Israel–Hamas War (and Iran’s cyber role):** The Israel-Hamas war itself did not directly involve the U.S., but it prompted warnings of increased Iranian hacking against Israeli and Western targets ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/21/israel-hamas-war-iran-hackers-cyberattacks-cybersecurity#:~:text=war%20www,the%20conflict%20and%20include%20destructive)). This backdrop provided a mild tailwind to cybersecurity stocks in late 2023, though the effect was less pronounced than in 2020. In the days after Oct 7, 2023, **cybersecurity shares rose modestly** as part of a broader defense rally. For instance, CrowdStrike (CRWD) climbed ~4% during the week after the Hamas attacks (also helped by market-wide gains), and Palo Alto Networks gained a few percent. There wasn’t a dramatic one-day spike attributable solely to the war, but the sector outperformed slightly on speculation of higher cyber defense spending. Some Israeli cyber firms saw upticks as well. **1-month after (early Nov 2023):** many cybersecurity names were trading higher than before the conflict (helped by the general market rebound). **3-months out:** by early 2024, cybersecurity stocks had continued their upward momentum (a lot of this due to secular trends and tech rally, rather than the war). In percentage terms, from Oct to Jan, CRWD was up ~15%+, PANW ~10%+, etc., though it’s hard to isolate the war effect. What’s clear is that *no negative impact* from the conflict was felt – if anything, the theme of heightened cyber threats provided a bullish narrative. 

**Overall:** In recent Iran-related conflicts, **cybersecurity stocks have reacted positively** to military escalations – they are viewed as beneficiaries of potential cyber warfare. **Day-1 and first-week returns** can be significant (mid to high single-digit percentage gains, as in Jan 2020) ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/cybersecurity-stocks-gain-as-iran-risk-could-bolster-demand-k52sckvo#:~:text=Shares%20of%20cybersecurity%20companies%20gained,will%20result%20in%20more%20business)) ([www.investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/usiran-tension-calls-for-investing-in-cybersecurity-stocks-200496962#:~:text=Evidently%2C%20the%20ETFMG%20Prime%20Cyber,after%20Iran%20threatened%20to%20retaliate)). But these stocks also tend to be high-beta, so if the geopolitical fear passes quickly, their gains can evaporate. The 2020 case is instructive: CrowdStrike and others spiked ~10% in anticipation of Iranian cyberattacks, only to fall back a few weeks later when those attacks didn’t materialize ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/crowdstrike-eyes-breakout-as-cyber-threats-boost-demand/#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20that,the%20immediate%20threat%20was%20over)). On the other hand, in a protracted conflict with active cyber components, one could see a more sustained rally in the sector. *For the 2023 conflict (which was more conventional), the cyber angle was secondary.* Thus, while there was a short-term bid under the likes of CRWD, Zscaler, Fortinet, etc., their performance was driven more by broader tech trends. 

**Note:** Cybersecurity has become a new “safe haven” sector in geopolitical strife (much like gold or defense stocks), but its moves can be **head-fake rallies** if the cyber threat doesn’t escalate. Traders should watch for actual increases in cyber incidents (or government contracts) to confirm any initial spike. 

## Gold & Precious Metals Performance 🥇🪙

**Gold as a Safe Haven:** Geopolitical conflicts almost always spur a rush into gold and precious metals, driving prices up. But the historical pattern shows **gold’s war-driven rallies often peak early and can reverse quickly** if the conflict is short. Let’s examine each case:

- **1990–91 Gulf War:** Leading up to the Gulf War, **gold saw a significant run-up** on fear and uncertainty. From early summer 1990 to shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait, gold prices jumped substantially. In fact, gold *“rallied more than $40 in the two months leading up to the start of the Gulf War”*, rising from an average ~$352/oz in June 1990 to about **$395/oz in August 1990** ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=%EF%BF%BDSource%3A%EF%BF%BDMorningstar%2C%20Inc,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)). This was roughly a +12% increase as investors sought safety amidst the Kuwait invasion. However, that **spike was short-lived**. Gold hit a high around $400 in late August, then **nose-dived** when there were hints of a peaceful resolution ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=Disaster%20potentially%20averted%20in%20the,after%20Iraq%E2%80%99s%20first%20peaceful%20overtures)). For example, on Aug 27–28, 1990, gold plunged about $27 in one day (from ~$412 to $385) as Saddam Hussein made conciliatory gestures ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=only%20to%20nose,first%20peaceful%20overtures)). By the end of August, gold was only ~$10 above its pre-crisis price ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20war%20premium%20has%20been,%E2%80%9D)). It fluctuated in the high-$300s through late 1990. When the actual Desert Storm air campaign began in January 1991, gold had a brief uptick (on the initial bombing news) but then fell. **By March 1991**, when Iraq agreed to a ceasefire, gold was back down to around **$363/oz** on average ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)) – almost exactly where it was before the invasion. **Returns:** If measured from the invasion date, gold’s *day-one* move was a sharp jump (a few percent). *One week* in, gold was up around 5–10%. *One month* after invasion, gold was near its highs (+10–12%). But by *3 months*, it had started to sag, and at *12 months (Aug 1991)* it was roughly flat versus a year prior. In essence, gold gave a *quick, sizable gain* to traders who bought during the lead-up fear and sold at the peak, but those who held through the *peace* saw gains evaporate ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20war%20premium%20has%20been,%E2%80%9D)) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)).

- **2003 Iraq War:** Geopolitical tensions in late 2002 had already been boosting gold (along with a weak dollar). Gold was on a tear in early 2003: it hit a **6-year high** of about **$382–$385/oz in early February 2003** amid the Iraq war build-up ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Mr%20Powell%27s%20address%20also%20saw,said%20one%20bullion%20trader)) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=prices%20have%20pulled%20back%20and,prices%20Stocks%20have%20fallen%20for)). Investors had poured into gold due to war worries, terrorism fears, and a falling USD. But as it became clear the U.S. invasion would be swift, gold actually **pulled back before the shooting started**. In the weeks just before the March 20, 2003 invasion, gold prices fell from the $380s down to the $330s. A CNNMoney article from Feb 7, 2003 cautioned that *“gold at a 6-year high… prices have pulled back… if you’re betting on the war premium, don’t [buy now]”* ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=into%20gold%20and%20gold%20shares,the%20potential%20for%20war%20with)) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=if%20these%20scary%20times%20have,fund%2C%20which%20is%20up%2033)) – essentially warning that gold’s run-up might have been overdone. Indeed, as the war commenced and went well for coalition forces, **gold dropped further**. It briefly popped when the war began (a knee-jerk move up), but then sold off as the conflict’s outcome looked assured. By late April 2003, gold was roughly in the mid-$300s, lower than the pre-war peak. (Later in 2003, gold resumed an upward trend due to other factors – low interest rates, dollar weakness – hitting ~$400 by year-end, but that was not because of the war per se.) **Summary:** Gold’s *war premium* in 2003 peaked about 6–8 weeks before the war, returned roughly to baseline around the invasion, and then moved with other macro forces. A trader playing gold purely for the Iraq war needed to exit by Jan/Feb 2003’s highs to capture the gains.

- **Jan 2020 Iran Crisis:** Gold reacted strongly to the U.S.-Iran confrontation. Already in late 2019 gold had been rising, and the spike in U.S.–Iran tensions gave it an extra push. On January 6, 2020, gold hit a **7-year high**, trading up to around **$1,580/oz** ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=,year%20high)). (It had been about $1,520 at the end of 2019, so that’s a ~4% jump in a few days.) This flight-to-safety came alongside surging oil and falling stocks globally. However, as with oil, once immediate war fears subsided, **gold’s rally paused**. After reaching ~$1585, gold pulled back slightly once it looked like direct war would be avoided by mid-January. But unlike oil, gold *didn’t* crash – it remained elevated through early 2020 (partly because investors were also hedging recession risk and expecting rate cuts). In fact, gold continued an upward trend during 2020 largely due to the pandemic and monetary stimulus, eventually breaking above $1,700 and even $2,000 later in 2020. Focusing just on the Iran conflict window: **Day 1:** gold up ~2% (in the immediate aftermath); **1-week:** up ~4–5% to multi-year highs ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/06/oil-70-dollars-stocks-shares-markets-us-iran-suleimani-trump-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with%3Ablock-5e12f1758f087e8308e694ca#:~:text=,year%20high)); **1-month:** roughly flat to slightly higher (as the Iran premium faded but other drivers kicked in). **3-months:** by April 2020 gold was higher, but that was mostly due to the pandemic chaos (gold is a multi-faceted safe haven). So the Iran conflict alone gave a quick pop that then blended into gold’s broader rally. 

- **Oct 2023 Hamas War:** Gold once again proved its safe-haven status. When the Israel-Hamas war erupted, gold caught a bid. On Oct 9, 2023, gold jumped about **+1.7%** (around +$30) to roughly **$1,875/oz** ([econcurrents.com](https://econcurrents.com/2023/10/09/09-oct-2023-market-close-major-financial-headlines-wall-street-main-indexes-open-sharply-lower-then-start-trending-upwards-after-discounting-many-israel-hamas-war-closing-moderately-higher-in/#:~:text=,008)). This was a strong one-day move (gold had been ~$1,840 the week prior). The war added to existing support for gold (as U.S. interest rates were peaking around then too). Over the following weeks in October, as Middle East tensions simmered (including concerns of a wider regional war), gold **continued to climb**, also helped by a pullback in US bond yields. By late October, gold briefly traded above **$2,000/oz**, its highest level since mid-2020. That represented about a **+10% gain** from pre-war levels. However, as the war remained contained and global risk sentiment improved into November, gold came off those highs. By December 2023, gold was back in the $1,900–1,950 range. So, **1-month after** the war’s start, gold was up significantly (thanks in part to war fears and in part to macro trends). **3-months after** (Jan 2024), gold was still somewhat higher than pre-war (a few percent up from early October), but off its panic highs. Notably, gold miners (GDX ETF, stocks like Newmont and Barrick) spiked alongside gold in October, then moderated. 

**Gold Miner Equities:** Precious metal mining stocks tend to leverage gold’s moves. During these conflicts, gold-mining companies (e.g., Newmont (NEM), Barrick Gold (GOLD), Goldcorp, etc.) rallied when gold prices surged. For instance, in early 2003, major gold miners were up ~25–35% year-over-year by February ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=Hot%20Rocks%20Top%20performing%20gold,%EF%BF%BD)), far outperforming the market (Newmont +29% YoY as gold spiked) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=Hot%20Rocks%20Top%20performing%20gold,%EF%BF%BD)). But when gold pulled back post-war, miners also dipped. In 2020, gold miners jumped in January (the Gold Miners ETF (GDX) rose in the first week of 2020) and performed well through the year due to gold’s record highs by August. In late 2023, gold mining stocks rose in October with the metal, then saw some profit-taking. 

**Takeaways:** Gold reliably jumps on the **onset of conflict** (“fear trade”). *Buyers of gold at the first sign of war have often seen immediate gains*: e.g., +5–10% moves during Gulf War and Hamas war spikes ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)) ([econcurrents.com](https://econcurrents.com/2023/10/09/09-oct-2023-market-close-major-financial-headlines-wall-street-main-indexes-open-sharply-lower-then-start-trending-upwards-after-discounting-many-israel-hamas-war-closing-moderately-higher-in/#:~:text=,008)). However, *those gains can vanish if you hold too long.* When conflicts are resolved or fears prove overblown, gold’s “war premium” can **peter out quickly** ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)) ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20war%20premium%20has%20been,%E2%80%9D)). Historical pattern: **“Buy the rumor (of war), sell the news (of peace).”** For example, in 1991 once the Gulf War combat ended, gold was **right back to pre-war levels** ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)). In 2003, gold’s war rally peaked before the first shot was fired, and early buyers had to exit before the invasion to profit. This suggests the **optimal gold trade** is to be positioned **before or at conflict onset, and take profits early**, rather than expecting gold to keep climbing throughout a short war. Over longer horizons, gold’s price will be influenced by inflation, interest rates, and currency dynamics more than the memory of a brief conflict. 

## Key Patterns and Trading Insights 📊💡

Analyzing these historical precedents reveals several **common patterns** and strategic insights for trading during geopolitical conflicts:

- **“Buy the Invasion, Sell the Peace” – Market Bottom Timing:** Markets tend to **decline ahead of and into the early phase of a conflict**, then bottom out and rally strongly once the conflict begins (when uncertainty starts clearing up). This is the classic “buy the invasion” phenomenon. For instance, the **S&P 500’s low in the Gulf War came ~2 months after Iraq’s invasion – just before the U.S.-led counterattack** ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)). Once the bombing campaign began in January 1991, stocks surged and never looked back ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)). Similarly, in **March 2003**, the stock market had been sliding for weeks, but **it bottomed essentially *the day before* the Iraq invasion** and then launched into a sustained rally ([www.statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/sandp-500-weekly-returns-for-oct-2001-to-march-2003#:~:text=Image%3A%20sandp%20500%20weekly%20returns,oct%202001%20to%20march%202003)) ([www.hennionandwalsh.com](https://www.hennionandwalsh.com/insights/stock-market-reactions-to-war-and-terrorist-attacks-a-historical-analysis/#:~:text=prior%20weeks%20of%20decline,might%20be%20shorter%20than%20anticipated)). These examples underscore that the **maximal fear (and market bottom)** often occurs **right around the start of hostilities**, after which sentiment improves. In retrospect, an investor who **bought equities on the day of invasion** (or immediately after) in 1991 or 2003 reaped huge gains in subsequent months ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)). Conversely, selling at the moment of “peace” (ceasefire or war end) was prudent – by that time, the relief rally is usually fully priced in. The key idea: **markets hate uncertainty more than war**. Once war begins (and its likely outcome becomes clearer), the uncertainty premia is removed and risk assets rally. Thus, the **market bottom often occurs within days of conflict onset** (or even just before, in anticipation). Empirically, in our cases: Gulf War bottom was ~**50 trading days after** the initial invasion (but a couple of days *before* the U.S. offensive) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)); Iraq War bottom was **literally -7 days before** the invasion (stocks turned up just as invasion became inevitable); Israel-Hamas 2023 bottom was ~**20 days after** conflict start (late Oct) once bond yields fell and worst escalation fears passed. So typically, anywhere from slightly before to a few weeks after start is the trough – a far shorter window than one might expect. 

- **How Many Days to Bottom:** In most modern conflicts the market has bottomed *very quickly* after fighting starts. The 1991 Gulf War: stocks bottomed in early Oct 1990, roughly ~**45 trading days after** the Aug 2 invasion (and more than 3 months before the war’s end) ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)). The 2003 Iraq War: stocks bottomed even earlier – about **a week before** the March 19 invasion date, as it became clear the U.S. would act ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)). The Russia-Ukraine war of 2022 (not part of the user’s list but another example) also saw U.S. markets bottom roughly one day after the invasion, then rally. This suggests an almost counter-intuitive point: **the optimal time to buy is very *soon* after conflict erupts**, because markets, having sold off in advance, rebound fast. For traders, waiting even 1–2 months into a war often means missing the bulk of the “relief” gains. History shows the S&P was **higher 22 trading days after the onset** of most crises in 21 out of 27 cases studied (average +3.8%) ([roughnotes.com](https://roughnotes.com/rnmagazine/2002/january02/01p113.htm#:~:text=For%20the%2022%20trading%20days,respectively)). By 3 months after, markets averaged +6–7% ([roughnotes.com](https://roughnotes.com/rnmagazine/2002/january02/01p113.htm#:~:text=Going%20further%20out%2C%20at%2063,where%20they%20had%20been%20before)). This reinforces that the turnaround from conflict can be swift. 

- **Sector Rotation and Peaks:** Different sectors rotate at different times during a conflict-driven cycle. Typically, **defensive and commodity sectors (energy, gold, defense stocks)** rally *first* – often **immediately at conflict onset**, driven by fear and speculation. However, these war-driven sector spikes often **peak early**. We saw **oil and gold prices usually peak within days or weeks of the conflict’s start**, then begin to reverse as the conflict progresses or as it becomes clear worst-case scenarios won’t happen ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)). For example, oil spiked before and at the outset of the Gulf and Iraq wars, then rolled over very quickly (peaking well before the conflicts ended) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=New%20York%20crude%20oil%20futures,growing%20threat%20of%20military%20conflict)). Gold’s “panic” peak also often coincides with the conflict’s early phase – in 1990 gold peaked within ~3 weeks of the invasion ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=only%20to%20nose,first%20peaceful%20overtures)), in early 2003 it peaked about 6 weeks before the invasion and then didn’t exceed that level during the war ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=into%20gold%20and%20gold%20shares,the%20potential%20for%20war%20with)) ([money.cnn.com](https://money.cnn.com/2003/02/05/markets/gold_investing/#:~:text=the%20start%20of%20the%20Persian,lot%20higher%20on%20the%20action)). **Defense stocks** likewise tend to **jump immediately** when conflict erupts (often hitting short-term highs in the first week or two) – e.g. many defense names gapped up to new highs right as the shooting started (1991, 2003, 2023 cases) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=increase%20in%20its%20daily%20returns,on%20October%209th%5B1)). They sometimes hold those highs a bit longer, but if the war is short, defense stocks can soften once the conflict winds down or if it doesn’t escalate further. On the other hand, **cyclical and growth sectors (tech, consumer discretionary, etc.)** often lag initially – they might fall during the pre-war uncertainty, then begin to rise **once the broader market finds its footing after the conflict starts**. For instance, in 1991 and 2003, the **broader market (tech, small-caps, etc.) really took off only after the initial oil/gold/defense frenzy**, leading a sustained rally in later months ([www.csmonitor.com](https://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0311/fwal11.html#:~:text=THE%20Gulf%20war%20has%20meant,and%20the%20Hambrecht%20%26amp%3B%20Quist)) ([www.csmonitor.com](https://www.csmonitor.com/1991/0311/fwal11.html#:~:text=Jarrett%20notes%20that%20by%20historical,a%20row%20of%20such%20advances)). In early 2003, once the war began, investors rotated *out* of safety trades and into beaten-down cyclicals (tech, financials) that then led the charge in the ensuing bull market. So, the **sector rotation sequence** tends to be: **before/at war start:** spike in *commodities (oil, gold)* and *defensive assets*; **during war:** rotation into *broader equities* as confidence returns; **after war ends:** the initial war trades (oil, gold, defense) may pull back (“sell the peace”), while sectors tied to economic recovery continue to do well if the conflict’s resolution improves the outlook. 

- **False Breakouts & Reversals:** A crucial insight for traders is identifying **“false breakouts” – sectors that pop on conflict news but then quickly reverse.** We have multiple examples: **Gold** often does this – rallies on fear, then plunges on any hint of peace or if the war is short. In late August 1990, gold’s spike was abruptly reversed by mere rumors of an Iraqi pullout (dropping ~$30 in a day) ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-08-29-fi-258-story.html#:~:text=only%20to%20nose,first%20peaceful%20overtures)) – a classic bull trap for late buyers. **Oil** did the same in 2003 – it rallied into March, then as soon as the invasion began (and it became clear oil fields were safe), oil prices tanked, catching anyone who bought oil or oil stocks right at the outbreak in a quick downdraft ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=New%20York%20crude%20oil%20futures,growing%20threat%20of%20military%20conflict)). **Cybersecurity stocks in 2020** also illustrated a false breakout: CrowdStrike, Palo Alto, etc. jumped 10%+ in anticipation of Iranian cyber war, only to **“give up those gains” within a month when heavy cyber retaliation didn’t occur ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/crowdstrike-eyes-breakout-as-cyber-threats-boost-demand/#:~:text=In%20the%20aftermath%20of%20that,the%20immediate%20threat%20was%20over)). Similarly, in 2023, some defense stocks that spiked on day one (e.g. a smaller drone maker or certain Israeli defense names) saw their prices fall back in following weeks if it looked like they’d overreacted. The lesson is to be cautious about chasing **initial spikes** – oftentimes, the **“war trade” is crowded and prices overshoot**, leading to a swift pullback once the immediate panic passes. Traders should watch for confirmation: e.g. did the conflict actually lead to sustained higher demand or disruption? If not, those sharp moves can reverse. **Selling into strength** of these fear-driven moves is usually wise unless you have conviction the conflict will deepen. 

- **Psychology – Worst Fears vs Reality:** Markets tend to **price in the worst-case scenario during the lead-up** (e.g. World War, oil embargo, etc.), but reality is often less dire. When the actual conflict unfolds, if it’s “manageable” or shorter than feared, markets rally. This was noted in a Newsweek piece during the 2003 war: *“the threat of war is worse than war itself”* – meaning the uncertainty and dread beforehand hurt stocks more than the war’s actual impact ([www.hennionandwalsh.com](https://www.hennionandwalsh.com/insights/stock-market-reactions-to-war-and-terrorist-attacks-a-historical-analysis/#:~:text=The%20invasion%20of%20Iraq%20in,might%20be%20shorter%20than%20anticipated)). Indeed, much of the **bearishness gets “baked in” before** the first shot is fired. That’s why the bottom is around the start. Then, as soon as clarity emerges (e.g., quick coalition victories, limited theater, etc.), markets rebound powerfully on relief. This pattern underscores a contrarian strategy: **when everybody is terrified of an impending war, that is often the time to buy**, not sell. Conversely, by the time peace is at hand and everyone is breathing a sigh of relief, a lot of good news is priced in – often a time to take profits. 

## Optimal Entry and Exit Timing ⏰⚖️

**Best Entry Points – “Peak Fear” Opportunities:** Historically, the optimal entry for a war-driven trade has been **just before or at the moment hostilities erupt**, when fear and uncertainty peak. Buying into the **deep market dips ahead of conflict** has yielded outsized returns. For broad equities: the data shows buying the S&P 500 **on the cusp of war** (e.g. days before or day of invasion) has been very profitable – the 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month returns from that point are strongly positive on average ([www.statmuse.com](https://www.statmuse.com/money/ask/sandp-500-weekly-returns-for-oct-2001-to-march-2003#:~:text=Image%3A%20sandp%20500%20weekly%20returns,oct%202001%20to%20march%202003)) ([roughnotes.com](https://roughnotes.com/rnmagazine/2002/january02/01p113.htm#:~:text=For%20the%2022%20trading%20days,respectively)). In practical terms: *Before* the Gulf War, the ideal buy was late Sep 1990 (when invasion fears and recession worries maxed out); before Iraq 2003, it was early Mar 2003 (right when diplomatic efforts failed and war was certain). Likewise, sector-wise, **buying defense stocks *immediately* as conflict starts** locked in the bulk of their move (they gapped up, but often ran further intraday or in initial sessions). For oil/gold, the optimal entry was a bit earlier – e.g. getting long oil or gold **in the pre-war buildup** (before everyone else piles in). Those who were long oil in summer 1990 or gold in late 2002 profited greatly once the crowd rushed in. The key is that once the war officially kicks off, **uncertainty begins to decrease**, and markets, paradoxically, often rally even amid bad headlines. Being a contrarian at that inflection (when news is worst but clarity increases) is crucial. 

**Exit Timing – How Long to Ride the “War Trade”:** The historical record suggests you should **not overstay your welcome in the initial fear trades (defense, oil, gold)**. These tend to have a **short half-life**. Optimal exit for those is typically **very early into the conflict or even right before a conflict is resolved**. For example, selling oil and gold *before* shooting stops – ideally around the time the war starts or shortly after, because we know those peaked early (Gulf War oil peaked ~5 months before war ended; gold peaked before war, etc.). In 1991, an investor who sold oil futures in January (as the air war began) would have avoided the crash that came weeks later. In 2003, taking profits on defense stocks a few weeks into the war (as the “victory” became apparent) was smart – defense shares paused after the initial euphoria. **“Sell the peace”** means when ceasefires or peace deals are on the horizon, it’s often a catalyst for the last leg down in gold/oil and potentially a cooling of defense names as well. Essentially, once the market senses the conflict is winding down, the risk premium evaporates. For equities broadly, if one is trading short-term, taking some profit *after a strong post-invasion rally* makes sense, because markets often price in a lot of good news quickly. For example, the S&P 500 rallied ~20% in 2 months after Desert Storm began ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)) – a trader could book gains then, rather than assume the pace would continue (indeed, after that initial burst, the market moved more modestly). That said, if the conflict’s resolution also removes a major overhang on the economy, staying invested can yield further upside longer-term (as seen post-2003, where exiting too early meant missing a multi-year bull run).

**Defense/Energy Premium Duration:** How long do the “war premiums” last? Historically: **Energy spikes have been shortest** – often measured in weeks. In both Gulf Wars, oil’s war premium evaporated **within 1–2 months** (or faster) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)) ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/asia-primed-for-stock-rally-but-iran-worry-lingers-markets-wrap#:~:text=U,Middle%20East%20Calm%3A%20Markets%20Wrap)). In 2020, it was basically one week ([www.bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-08/asia-primed-for-stock-rally-but-iran-worry-lingers-markets-wrap#:~:text=U,Middle%20East%20Calm%3A%20Markets%20Wrap)). So energy/oil trades must be nimble. **Defense stock premiums** can last a bit longer, but still tend to be front-loaded. In 1991, defense stocks held their war gains for a few months but then faced the reality of defense budget cuts – by later in 1991 some gave back gains. In 2003, defense stocks’ premium (vs the market) persisted throughout the Iraq War years because the conflict *expanded* (insurgency, War on Terror), leading to sustained spending – an exception where the premium became more permanent. In 2022’s Russia-Ukraine conflict (outside our main list, but instructive), European defense stocks have stayed elevated for **years** because that war persisted and defense budgets increased significantly – showing that a *long/unresolved war keeps the defense premium intact*. But for *short wars*, the extra boost to defense stocks usually lasts only a few months. **Gold’s premium** usually unwinds quickly once rates or currencies reassert control – gold might fall immediately when war ends (1991) or even during the war if it was front-run (2003). So traders in gold often aim to exit around conflict peak uncertainty, not the resolution.

**Drawdowns and Risk Management:** Each sector has different drawdown profiles during conflicts. **Broad market:** often enters a conflict already down ~10–20% from recent highs (fear-driven selloff). For example, before the Gulf War the S&P was down ~–15% ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)); before Iraq War 2003 the S&P had been down ~–14% from Dec’02 to Mar’03 lows. That means the market was “oversold” going in. Those drawdowns set the stage for big rebounds once worst fears didn’t occur. **Defense stocks:** tended not to draw down as much in pre-war periods – they often *rose* while the market fell (as seen in late 1990, defense names were relatively strong, and in early 2003 many defense stocks were near highs even as the market was making lows). So their “drawdowns” were smaller or non-existent heading in. The flip side: defense could fall when the market rose later (rotation). **Energy stocks:** can be volatile – sometimes they rise if oil rises (e.g. 1990), so not much drawdown (they can even make gains while market drops). But if a conflict triggers recession fears (like 1990 did cause a brief recession), some energy equities could still dip with the market initially despite higher oil. Generally though, energy had less drawdown *going in* and more of a crash *coming out* (when oil prices crashed). **Drawdown during conflict:** If one mistimes and buys the wrong asset at the wrong time (say, buys stocks too early before war when panic is still building, or holds oil too long), drawdowns can be steep. For instance, someone who bought S&P in mid-August 1990 still had to endure another ~10% drop to the October bottom. Or someone long oil in October 1990 saw a ~50% drawdown by Feb 1991. Thus, managing position size and using stop-loss levels is important in such trades – war markets are whipsaw. 

**Optimal Strategy Synthesis:** In an Iran–US–Israel conflict scenario (the context of this research), these lessons suggest an **optimal playbook**:  **(1)** Consider accumulating positions in oversold **broad market or cyclical stocks *before or at conflict outbreak***, when pessimism and volatility are high – history shows that within 1–3 months, indices often recover strongly from that point. **(2)** Potentially go long select **defense stocks early**, but plan to take profits relatively soon (weeks to a few months into conflict), unless evidence shows the war will be protracted. **(3)** If trading **oil or oil stocks**, be extremely nimble – enter early (if you foresee conflict risk) and **exit on the initial price spike**, because oil’s war premium tends to vanish quickly (often faster than one expects). In other words, use oil as a quick tactical trade, not a long-term hold through war. **(4)** **Gold** can be bought as a hedge before conflict, but one should watch for any diplomatic progress or quick resolution – that’s the cue to exit gold longs because gold will drop on “peace.” Keep an eye on real interest rates too – if they rise, gold can fall even if war tension is still high (as seen in late 2023, gold’s surge was helped by falling yields). **(5)** **Cybersecurity stocks** could be a niche play if the conflict involves state-sponsored hacking (e.g. significant Iranian cyberattacks). One might buy a basket of cyber names at conflict onset – but again plan to sell once the initial hype is priced in (usually a few weeks), unless cyber incidents actually escalate (in which case hold a bit longer). **(6)** Use options or hedges to manage risk – war news can surprise (e.g. if conflict broadens unexpectedly, oil could spike higher than anticipated, or a second front opens). Having some protective puts or inversely correlated trades can buffer against an adverse scenario. 

**Historical Drawdowns by Sector:** For context, during the Gulf War bear market (1990), the S&P 500 fell ~–19.9% peak-to-trough ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2025/06/22/its-not-the-1990s-gulf-war/#:~:text=The%20start%20and%20end%20of,as%20the%20April%202025%20lows)). Energy stocks dropped initially in that recession but then rallied with oil – some oil-focused indices were actually up when the market was at its worst. Defense stocks in 1990 had much shallower drawdowns than the S&P (they were viewed as safe havens – some even rose). During the 2003 pre-war period, the S&P fell about –14% from December 2002 to March 2003; defense stocks were flat/up in that same span (they acted as relative winners). In the 2023 episode, the market was already in a ~–7% pullback (Aug to early Oct 2023) mainly due to interest rates, not war. The war added a brief extra dip to ~–10%, then the market bounced. Defense stocks *gained* while the market fell in Oct 2023 (inverse correlation), and energy stocks were mixed (oil up helped, but recession fears hurt later). **The general pattern:** in war scares, **defense and commodities often have *negative correlation* to the broad market** – they go up when the market goes down. That provides a useful hedge property. An optimal strategy could involve rotating profits from those **initial gainers into the laggards** (i.e., sell some defense/oil after big spikes and use proceeds to buy beaten-down cyclicals that are ready to rebound as the conflict becomes clearer). That way, one captures the fear trade and then the recovery trade. 

In summary, history suggests a conflict-driven market cycle where **fear trades (defense, oil, gold)** surge early – savvy traders take profits before the reversal – and **broad equities bottom early in the conflict** – the opportunity to deploy capital into oversold stocks for the subsequent relief rally. By understanding these precedents, one can better time entries and exits in each sector when facing a new Iran–US–Israel conflict scenario, increasing the odds of capitalizing on the market’s rhythm in crises ([www.newsweek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/stocks-surge-war-starts-132485#:~:text=Still%2C%20if%20recent%20history%20is,for%20this%20conflict%20as%20well)) ([www.theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/feb/06/iraq.internationalnews#:~:text=Expectations%20raised%20by%20Mr%20Powell,in%20the%20price%20of%20crude)). Each conflict is unique, but human psychology and market mechanics often rhyme with the past, providing a valuable roadmap.
