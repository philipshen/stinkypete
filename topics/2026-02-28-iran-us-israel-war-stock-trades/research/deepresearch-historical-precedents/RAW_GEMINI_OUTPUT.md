# Historical Precedents & Market Patterns: Market Performance During Geopolitical Conflicts

### Executive Summary & Key Findings
Research into market behavior during the Gulf War (1990), Iraq War (2003), 2020 US-Iran tensions, and the 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict reveals a consistent psychological pattern: **markets despise uncertainty more than conflict itself.**

*   **The "Buy the Invasion" Phenomenon:** In prolonged buildups (1990–1991 and 2003), equity markets bottomed *before* or immediately upon the commencement of major combat operations. The S&P 500 rallied 18.3% during Operation Desert Storm and over 26% in the year following the 2003 Iraq invasion [cite: 1, 2].
*   **Defense Sector Alpha:** Defense stocks (LMT, NOC, GD) reliably generate significant alpha in the immediate aftermath (Day 1 to 1-Month) of kinetic events. In the 2023 Hamas attack, defense stocks gapped up ~9-11% in a single session, decoupling entirely from the broader market [cite: 3, 4].
*   **The Energy Fade:** While oil prices spike on the initial shock (e.g., +89% post-Kuwait invasion 1990), they historically reverse quickly once the scope of the conflict is defined or if strategic reserves are released. In 2003, oil prices *fell* 21% following the invasion as the "war premium" evaporated [cite: 1].
*   **Asymmetric Volatility:** Short, sharp shocks (Soleimani 2020) produce transient volatility that is often fully recovered within weeks, whereas structural shifts (Gulf War 1990) causing energy supply shocks can suppress equities for months [cite: 5].

## 1. S&P 500 Broad Market Performance

The broader market reaction varies significantly based on the economic context (recession vs. growth) and the duration of the pre-war uncertainty.

### Gulf War (1990–1991)
*Context: Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug 2, 1990. Operation Desert Storm began Jan 17, 1991. The market was already weakening due to recession fears.*

*   **Event Date:** August 2, 1990 (Invasion of Kuwait)
*   **Market Reaction:** The S&P 500 entered a correction, bottoming in October 1990, roughly 71 days after the invasion [cite: 5, 6]. However, the commencement of the US counter-offensive (Desert Storm) in Jan 1991 triggered a massive rally.

| Period | Return | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1 (Aug 2, 1990)** | -1.1% | Initial shock of invasion [cite: 7]. |
| **1-Week** | -5.7% | S&P 500 sold off for 6 straight days [cite: 8]. |
| **1-Month** | -9.3% | By end of Aug 1990, fears of oil shock took hold [cite: 9]. |
| **3-Month** | -13.5% | Market bottomed in Oct 1990 [cite: 6, 10]. |
| **12-Month** | +10.2% | Massive rally following the "success" of Desert Storm [cite: 10]. |

### Iraq War (2003)
*Context: US invasion began March 20, 2003. This followed months of "will they/won't they" uncertainty. The market bottomed on March 11, roughly one week before bombs fell.*

| Period | Return | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1 (Mar 20, 2003)** | +0.2% | Market had already rallied 8 days prior anticipating the war [cite: 11]. |
| **1-Week** | +3.0% | "Relief rally" that uncertainty was over [cite: 12]. |
| **1-Month** | +5.3% | S&P rose despite initial volatility [cite: 8]. |
| **3-Month** | +14.5% | Major bull run began March 2003 [cite: 13]. |
| **12-Month** | +26.7% | Post-invasion recovery coincided with economic recovery [cite: 2]. |

### 2020 Iran Tensions (Soleimani Strike)
*Context: US airstrike killed Qasem Soleimani on Jan 3, 2020. High fears of WWIII, but no sustained ground war.*

| Period | Return | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1 (Jan 3, 2020)** | -0.71% | Knee-jerk selloff on geopolitical fear [cite: 14, 15]. |
| **1-Week** | +0.8% | Market quickly realized conflict would remain contained. |
| **1-Month** | +0.5% | Volatility subsided quickly until COVID-19 fears took over later. |
| **3-Month** | -20.0% | *Note: Data skewed by COVID-19 crash in March 2020.* |

### 2023 Hamas-Israel Conflict
*Context: Oct 7, 2023 attacks occurred on a Saturday. Markets reacted Monday, Oct 9.*

| Period | Return | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Day 1 (Oct 9, 2023)** | +0.63% | Market opened lower but reversed to close green [cite: 16]. |
| **1-Week** | +0.5% | Resilience despite fears of regional escalation [cite: 17]. |
| **1-Month** | +2.1% | Markets shrugged off the conflict relatively quickly. |
| **3-Month** | +11.5% | Strong rally into year-end 2023. |

## 2. Defense & Aerospace Sector Performance

Defense stocks exhibit the most reliable "flight to safety" mechanics during conflict, particularly when the conflict involves U.S. hardware or the threat of escalation requiring missile defense systems.

### Comparative Returns: Day 1 & 1-Month Post-Event

| Stock | Gulf War (1990) Day 1 / 1-Mo | Iraq War (2003) Day 1 / 1-Mo | Soleimani (2020) Day 1 / 1-Mo | Israel-Hamas (2023) Day 1 / 1-Mo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LMT** | +2.2% / +5.0% [cite: 18] | +2.5% / -3.0% [cite: 19] | +3.6% / +10.2% [cite: 20] | **+8.9%** / +5.5% [cite: 4] |
| **NOC** | +2.0% / +3.8% [cite: 21] | +0.5% / -2.5% [cite: 21] | **+5.4%** / +9.8% [cite: 20] | **+11.4%** / +6.2% [cite: 4] |
| **GD** | +1.5% / -42%* [cite: 22] | +1.0% / +4.5% [cite: 23] | +1.3% / +3.1% [cite: 24] | +8.4% / +3.5% [cite: 3] |
| **RTX** | N/A | N/A | +1.5% / +4.0% [cite: 20] | +4.6% / -2.5% [cite: 4] |
| **BA** | -1.5% / -10% | +1.2% / -3.5% | +0.1% / -5.0% | -1.3% / -5.0% |

*Note: General Dynamics (GD) faced specific internal restructuring issues in 1990 unrelated to the war which depressed its longer-term returns during that specific period [cite: 22].*

**Performance Insights:**
*   **Outperformers:** Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) consistently outperform heavily during missile/air-threat conflicts due to their dominance in missile defense and aircraft [cite: 3, 4].
*   **Underperformers:** Boeing (BA) frequently underperforms pure-play defense stocks during conflicts because it has significant commercial aviation exposure, which suffers when war disrupts travel or spikes fuel prices [cite: 25].
*   **2023 Breakout:** The Oct 9, 2023 session saw the largest non-earnings jump for LMT since 2020, signaling a market repricing of long-term geopolitical instability [cite: 4].

---

## 3. Energy & Oil Sector Performance

The energy sector is highly sensitive to the *location* of the conflict. Middle East conflicts trigger immediate risk premiums, but these premiums often evaporate faster than stock markets anticipate.

### Oil Price (WTI) Movements
*   **Gulf War (1990):** WTI rose from ~$21 to ~$40 (+90%) between Aug and Oct 1990. It crashed ~30% the day the US air campaign (Desert Storm) began in Jan 1991 [cite: 1, 26].
*   **Iraq War (2003):** Oil rose ~35% in the lead-up. It peaked at ~$37 before the invasion and fell 21% to ~$28 as the invasion commenced [cite: 27, 28].
*   **Soleimani (2020):** Spiked +4% intraday to ~$63 but erased gains within 5 days as no supply disruption materialized [cite: 29].
*   **Israel-Hamas (2023):** Rose ~4% initially ($82 to $86) but trended lower over the next 3 months (-22%) due to non-regional supply strength (US production) [cite: 1].

### Energy Stock Returns (XOM, CVX, HAL)

| Ticker | Gulf War (1990) 1-Mo / 12-Mo | Iraq War (2003) 1-Mo / 12-Mo | Soleimani (2020) 1-Mo / 3-Mo | Hamas (2023) 1-Mo / 3-Mo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XOM** | +8.8% / +25% [cite: 30] | -1.5% / +20% [cite: 31] | -5.0% / -37%* | -2.4% / -8% [cite: 32] |
| **CVX** | +9.5% / +20% [cite: 33] | -2.0% / +26% [cite: 33] | -4.5% / -35%* | -1.8% / -6% [cite: 34] |
| **HAL** | +15% / +40% | +5.0% / +80%** | -8.0% / -50%* | +2.0% / -5% |

*\*2020 Energy returns were severely impacted by the COVID-19 demand collapse, rendering the 3-month and 12-month data outliers.*
*\*\*Halliburton (HAL) outperformed massively post-2003 invasion due to reconstruction contracts in Iraq [cite: 35].*

## 4. Cybersecurity Sector Performance

This sector is a "modern war" play, becoming relevant only in recent conflicts (2020, 2023) as cyber warfare became a recognized domain of escalation.

### 2020 Iran Tensions & 2023 Israel-Hamas

| Stock | Jan 3, 2020 (Soleimani) Day 1 / 1-Week | Oct 9, 2023 (Hamas) Day 1 / 1-Week |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PANW** | +1.5% / +3.0% [cite: 36] | +2.3% / +5.0% [cite: 37] |
| **CRWD** | +1.0% / +4.5% [cite: 38] | -1.5% / +2.0% [cite: 37] |
| **FTNT** | +0.8% / +2.0% [cite: 39] | +1.2% / +3.0% |
| **ZS** | N/A | +4.0% / +7.5% [cite: 37] |

**Insights:**
*   **Specific Exposure:** In 2023, stocks with heavy R&D in Israel (like Check Point - CHKP and SentinelOne) initially underperformed or dropped due to operational risks, while US-based diversified majors like PANW rallied on expectations of increased global cyber spending [cite: 37].
*   **Flight to Quality:** Recent patterns show investors flock to "platform" cybersecurity stocks (PANW, CRWD) during geopolitical tension, anticipating state-sponsored cyber retaliation.

## 5. Gold & Precious Metals Performance

Gold acts as the "fear gauge," typically spiking on the *rumor* of war and selling off once the conflict becomes kinetic and predictable.

| Conflict | Spot Price Move | GLD/Gold Return (1-Mo) | 12-Month Return |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gulf War (1990)** | +15% pre-invasion; Spiked to $416, then fell to $370 by end of war [cite: 40]. | +8% (Aug-Sept 1990) | -2.7% (Ended 1990 down) [cite: 41]. |
| **Iraq War (2003)** | Rallied 19.5% in 2003 (Bull market start) [cite: 42]. | -4.0% (Mar-Apr 2003) | +24.1% [cite: 2]. |
| **Soleimani (2020)** | Spiked +1.6% to 4-month high ($1,550) [cite: 43]. | +4.5% | +24.8% (Driven by COVID/Rates) [cite: 44]. |
| **Hamas (2023)** | +6.8% rally in Oct 2023 [cite: 45]. | +7.3% | +20% (approx). |

**Pattern:** Gold spikes immediately (safe haven) but sustains gains only if the conflict threatens broad economic stability or currency debasement. Short regional conflicts (like Soleimani 2020) result in gold spikes that reverse within days.

## 6. Key Patterns and Trading Insights

### "Buy the Invasion, Sell the Peace"
Historical data confirms a counter-intuitive pattern:
*   **The Bottom:** Markets typically bottom **1–2 weeks before** or **on the exact day** invasion operations begin.
    *   *Gulf War:* Bottomed Oct 1990 (max uncertainty), rallied hard Jan 1991 (start of air war) [cite: 46].
    *   *Iraq War:* Bottomed March 11, 2003; Invasion March 20, 2003. S&P 500 rallied 8 straight days leading into the war [cite: 11].
*   **Why:** Markets price in the *worst-case scenario* during the buildup. Once the war starts, the timeline becomes "known," and the risk premium is removed.

### Sector Rotation
1.  **Immediate Shock (Day 0-3):** Energy and Defense outperform. Airlines and Consumer Discretionary dump aggressively [cite: 16].
2.  **Stabilization (Week 1-4):** Energy typically peaks and rolls over (e.g., 1991, 2003). Defense stocks often hold gains but momentum slows.
3.  **Recovery (Month 1+):** Tech and broad equities tend to lead the recovery once the "end of the world" scenario is priced out.

### False Breakout Patterns
*   **Oil:** The 1990 Gulf War saw a sustained oil spike (+89%), but virtually every Middle East conflict since (2003, 2006, 2020, 2023) saw oil spikes reverse within 2 months [cite: 1]. **Trading Insight:** Shorting oil spikes post-invasion has historically been a high-probability trade unless physical supply infrastructure (pipelines/Strait of Hormuz) is physically destroyed.

---

## 7. Optimal Entry/Exit Timing

Based on historical drawdowns and recoveries:

*   **Best Entry Point (Broad Market):** The period of maximum anxiety *prior* to the first missile strike. In 2003, this was roughly 10 days before the invasion. In 1991, it was the start of the air campaign.
    *   *Insight:* Do not wait for the war to end; buy when the war *starts*.
*   **Defense Premiums:** The "War Premium" in stocks like LMT/NOC typically lasts 1–3 months. In 2003, the defense sector almost tripled over the next 4 years, suggesting it is a long-term hold during protracted conflicts [cite: 3].
*   **Energy Exits:** Historical data suggests selling Energy/Oil positions 2–4 weeks after the conflict starts, as the supply fear premium dissipates (seen in 1991, 2003, and 2023) [cite: 1].

### Historical Drawdown Data
*   **Pearl Harbor:** -19.8% drawdown, 143 days to bottom.
*   **Gulf War (1990):** -16.9% drawdown, 71 days to bottom [cite: 5].
*   **Iraq War (2003):** Market rallied *into* the war; drawdown occurred *before* the conflict (-14% in lead up).
*   **Soleimani (2020):** -0.7% drawdown (recovered in days).
