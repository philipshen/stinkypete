# Quick Research: CISA Emergency Funding Allocation (Private Sector vs Internal)

## Question
What is the specific allocation of CISA's emergency funding toward private-sector cybersecurity vendors versus internal government capabilities?

## Key Findings

### FY2026 CISA Budget
- **Total CISA budget:** $2.4-2.6 billion (debated; ~$300M less than current annual budget under proposed cuts)
- **Cybersecurity allocation:** $1,367.4 million for cybersecurity efforts
- **Focus areas:** Protecting Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) networks, partnering with SLTT governments and private sector

### Budget Headwinds
- **Trump FY2026 budget proposed $163B cut** to non-defense spending, including CISA and FEMA funding cuts
- CISA faces potential de-prioritization of non-federal, non-critical-infrastructure organizations
- State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program extended through end of FY2026

### Private Sector Flow-Through
- CISA's Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) brings together major tech providers (including PANW, CRWD, etc.)
- Budget cuts could **increase** reliance on private-sector vendors as CISA reduces internal capabilities
- No specific dollar breakdown available between CISA internal spending vs private vendor contracts

### Key Programs Benefiting Private Vendors
- Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program -- deploys commercial cybersecurity tools across FCEB agencies
- CyberSentry program -- public-private threat monitoring partnership
- Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act provisions extended

### Implication for Trade Cards
The paradox: CISA budget cuts actually **increase** private vendor demand as agencies outsource capabilities they can no longer maintain internally. PANW (GSA OneGov), CRWD (EDR), ZS (zero trust), and FTNT (OT) all benefit from federal agencies seeking commercial solutions. However, emergency supplemental appropriations for cyber (beyond base budget) have NOT been passed as of Feb 28, limiting the near-term spending surge to existing budget authority and reprogramming.
