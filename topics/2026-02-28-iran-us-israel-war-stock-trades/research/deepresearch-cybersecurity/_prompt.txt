Research the following topic in depth:

TOPIC: Cybersecurity Beneficiaries — Iran's APT capabilities, expected cyber escalation, and which cyber stocks (CRWD, PANW, FTNT, ZS) benefit most from government/enterprise spending surge

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into Iran-US/Israel war stock trades. The final output is an interactive HTML file with trade cards for various sectors affected by an Iran-US/Israel military conflict. The cybersecurity sector card should cover CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Zscaler and other relevant cyber stocks that would benefit from increased government/enterprise cybersecurity spending driven by Iranian cyber escalation.

Please provide:
1. A comprehensive analysis of Iran's APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) capabilities, including known groups (APT33/Elfin, APT34/OilRig, APT35/Charming Kitten, MuddyWater, etc.), their historical targets, and their evolution in sophistication
2. Historical precedent for cyber escalation during US-Iran tensions (e.g., post-Soleimani, Stuxnet retaliation, attacks on Saudi Aramco, Albanian government attacks)
3. Expected cyber escalation scenarios in a full-scale Iran-US/Israel military conflict — likely targets (critical infrastructure, financial systems, energy sector, government networks)
4. Analysis of which cybersecurity companies (CRWD, PANW, FTNT, ZS, and others) are best positioned to benefit from:
   - Increased US government cybersecurity spending (federal contracts, CISA mandates)
   - Enterprise spending surge driven by heightened threat environment
   - Specific technical capabilities relevant to Iranian TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures)
5. Revenue exposure, government contract positions, and competitive advantages for each major cyber stock
6. Historical stock performance of cybersecurity companies during past geopolitical crises and cyber escalation events
7. Risk factors — could a major breach hurt a specific vendor? Valuation concerns? Competitive dynamics?
8. Key risks and bear cases for the cybersecurity trade thesis
9. All source URLs for claims made
10. A list of open questions or areas that need further investigation

Focus on accuracy and cite your sources.
