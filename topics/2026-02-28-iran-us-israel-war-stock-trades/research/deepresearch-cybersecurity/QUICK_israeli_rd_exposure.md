# Quick Research: Israeli R&D Exposure for Cyber Companies (PANW via CyberArk)

## Question
How exposed are each company's Israeli R&D operations to physical conflict disruption (especially PANW via CyberArk)?

## Key Findings

### PANW Israeli Workforce (Post-CyberArk)
- **Total Israel employees:** ~2,600 (up from ~1,600 pre-acquisition)
- **Office space:** 22 floors in Tel Aviv's Alon Tower + CyberArk offices in Petah Tikva (~55,000 sqm total)
- **Israel is PANW's second-largest R&D hub** after Santa Clara
- PANW has made 6+ Israeli acquisitions historically (Cyvera, Demisto, Bridgecrew, Talon, CyberArk, others)
- Israel described as PANW's "strategic core" for R&D (per Calcalistech feature)
- **Planning dual listing on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange** -- deepens Israeli commitment

### CyberArk Pre-Acquisition
- ~1,200 employees at Petah Tikva HQ and Be'er Sheva R&D center
- Core PAM technology developed in Israel
- IDF reservist call-up risk: ~15% peak mobilization rate after Oct 7, 2023 declined to ~4% by March 2025

### Other Cyber Companies' Israeli Exposure
- **CRWD:** No significant Israeli R&D operations. Primarily US/India engineering.
- **ZS:** Minimal Israeli presence. R&D centered in San Jose and India.
- **FTNT:** No major Israeli R&D center. Primarily Sunnyvale, Ottawa, and Sophia Antipolis (France).
- **CHKP (Check Point):** HQ in Tel Aviv, ~5,000 employees in Israel. Most exposed of cyber names.

### Physical Disruption Risk Assessment
- **PANW:** MODERATE-HIGH. ~2,600 employees, Israel is strategic R&D core. Direct missile strikes on Tel Aviv or prolonged reserve duty call-ups would disrupt development pipeline. However, Oct 2023-2025 experience showed Israeli tech companies adapted effectively (remote work, relocated production lines, recruited replacements).
- **CRWD/ZS/FTNT:** LOW. Minimal or no Israeli operations.
- **Mitigant:** PANW's distributed global engineering means Israel disruption slows but does not halt product development. CyberArk standalone products may experience version update delays.

### Implication for Trade Cards
PANW's Israeli R&D concentration is a real but manageable risk. The Oct 2023 precedent showed Israeli tech companies maintaining output despite wartime conditions. The bigger risk for PANW is the CyberArk integration disruption (layoffs + reorg) compounding with conflict-related Israeli workforce disruption. This should be noted as a risk factor on the PANW trade card but does not change the core thesis (GSA OneGov + war-driven demand).
