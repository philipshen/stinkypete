# Quick Research: PANW-CyberArk Acquisition Integration Timeline

## Question
How quickly can PANW integrate CyberArk's sales force to capitalize on the GSA OneGov vehicle?

## Key Findings

### Acquisition Completion
- **Closed:** February 11, 2026 (deal announced mid-2025, ~8 months to close)
- **Deal value:** $25 billion ($45 cash + 2.2005 PANW shares per CyberArk share)
- **Second-largest Israeli tech exit in history**

### Integration Approach
- CyberArk's Identity Security solutions will **continue as standalone platform** initially
- Near-term integration focus: CyberArk PAM into Prisma Cloud and Cortex XSIAM platforms
- Goal: real-time credential exploitation detection alongside attack telemetry
- Existing CyberArk customers will experience "no disruption"

### Workforce Impact
- PANW **laid off hundreds of CyberArk employees** within one day of closing (per Calcalistech)
- Over 500 CyberArk jobs cut post-close (per Calcalistech/CTech)
- PANW Israeli workforce grew from ~1,600 to ~2,600 employees post-acquisition
- PANW expanding Israeli office space (22 floors in Tel Aviv's Alon Tower + CyberArk's Petah Tikva offices, ~55,000 sqm total)
- PANW planning Tel Aviv Stock Exchange listing (dual listing)

### GSA OneGov Implications
- The GSA OneGov contract is PANW's vehicle -- CyberArk PAM can be sold through this existing government channel
- Integration of CyberArk's privileged access management directly counters Iranian APT credential-harvesting tactics
- However, the layoffs suggest aggressive cost optimization that may slow sales integration in the near term

### Risk Assessment
- **Short-term risk:** Layoffs and reorganization create 3-6 month integration disruption to CyberArk's sales motion
- **Medium-term benefit:** CyberArk PAM bundled into PANW platformization drives cross-sell to GSA OneGov federal accounts
- **Key watch:** Q3 FY2026 earnings (May 2026) for first integration revenue metrics
