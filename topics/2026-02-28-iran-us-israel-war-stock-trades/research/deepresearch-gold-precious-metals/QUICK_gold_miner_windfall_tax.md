# Quick Research: Gold Miner Windfall Tax Risks

## Question
Whether any jurisdictions are signaling royalty increases or windfall taxes for gold miners operating at $3,000+/oz margins.

## Findings

- **Gold has surged past $5,000/oz as of late February 2026**, driven by the Iran-US/Israel war, geopolitical fractures, and dollar-decoupling dynamics. Newmont reported record $7.2B income and Barrick Gold achieved 70% margins at Tier One assets. The industry is in a "Gilded Era" of "super-margins," making windfall tax debates acute and politically attractive for resource-rich governments.

- **Zimbabwe is the clearest case study -- and it backed down.** Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube initially proposed doubling the gold royalty rate from 5% to 10% for gold sold above $2,501/oz in the 2026 budget. After intense pushback from miners and industry groups, the revised budget (passed Dec 2025) maintains the 5% royalty for gold prices between $1,200-$5,000/oz, with the 10% windfall rate only triggered above $5,000/oz. This threshold is now being tested given current prices.

- **Ghana has tabled a mining windfall tax bill to parliament.** This is a significant signal from Africa's largest gold producer. The specific rates and thresholds are still under legislative debate, but the political momentum is real. Tanzania already has one of the world's most taxed mining sectors (effective rates near 60%+ including royalties, inspection fees, and withholding taxes) and has historically been aggressive about capturing windfall profits.

- **Broader jurisdictional risk is rising but action lags.** Industry analysts warn that "nations with significant gold deposits may seek to increase taxes or nationalize resources to capture more of the windfall profits." Historically, governments have introduced royalty or taxation regime changes during high-price cycles, but there is typically a 6-18 month lag between price spikes and legislative action. Chile, Peru, Australia (particularly Western Australia), and several sub-Saharan African nations are the jurisdictions most commonly flagged as potential actors, though none besides Zimbabwe and Ghana have introduced specific proposals as of late February 2026.

- **The windfall is partially self-hedging.** Rising energy costs, labor inflation, and increased royalty payments driven by the same geopolitical tensions fueling gold prices are compressing net margins somewhat. Miners are also facing increased pressure to invest in local infrastructure and ESG projects as the "social license to operate" becomes more expensive. Companies with operations concentrated in stable jurisdictions (Nevada, Ontario, Western Australia) face lower windfall tax risk than those with significant African or Latin American exposure.
