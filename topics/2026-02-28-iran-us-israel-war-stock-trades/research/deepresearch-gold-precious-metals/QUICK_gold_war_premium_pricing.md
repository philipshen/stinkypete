# Quick Research: Gold War Premium Pricing Analysis

## Question
Whether current ~$5,200/oz gold already prices in the full Iran war scenario or if meaningful upside remains from further escalation.

## Findings
- **Gold has NOT fully priced in a full-scale war.** As of Feb 28, 2026, gold surged past $5,300/oz (+1.75% intraday) following the announcement of US "major combat operations" in Iran and Israeli pre-emptive missile strikes. Silver jumped 7.67% to $94.30/oz. The move from ~$5,100 to $5,300 in a single week confirms the market was NOT positioned for kinetic action of this magnitude -- there is still a repricing underway.
- **Analyst targets suggest $500-$2,000/oz of upside remains.** Deutsche Bank targets $6,000; Wells Fargo recently raised its year-end target to $6,300; SocGen says $6,000 could look "conservative"; UBS has an extreme upside case of $7,200/oz driven by escalation scenarios. Even the median of these ($6,150) implies ~$850/oz or ~16% upside from current levels.
- **Scenario-based models frame the range.** Regional conflict containment models price gold at $5,200-$5,800 during active but limited military operations, with normalization toward $4,800-$5,400 over a 12-month recovery. A wider war (Strait of Hormuz closure, Tehran retaliation on Gulf states/Dubai) would push toward the $6,000-$7,200 band.
- **Structural tailwinds amplify the war premium.** The gold rally is not purely geopolitical -- it sits on top of persistent de-dollarization trends, central bank buying (especially China/India), and expected Fed rate cuts (2-3 cuts priced for 2026). These structural flows mean that even if the war premium partially fades, gold is unlikely to retrace below $4,800-$5,000.
- **Key escalation triggers for further upside:** (1) Strait of Hormuz disruption/closure, (2) Iranian retaliation against Gulf oil infrastructure or Dubai, (3) broader regional conflict drawing in Hezbollah/Houthis at scale, (4) US casualty events that signal prolonged engagement. Each of these could add $200-$500/oz in war premium on top of current levels.
