# Current Gold Market Dynamics (Late February 2026)

Gold prices have surged to record highs above $5,000 per ounce as of late February 2026 ([malaysia.news.yahoo.com](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=Gold%20prices%20rose%20on%20Friday,demand%20for%20safe%20haven%20assets)). This massive rally has been driven by a confluence of factors. **Escalating geopolitical tensions** – particularly the looming conflict involving Iran versus the U.S. and Israel – have spurred intense *safe-haven* demand ([malaysia.news.yahoo.com](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=Gold%20prices%20rose%20on%20Friday,demand%20for%20safe%20haven%20assets)). Investors typically flock to gold during severe crises or war fears, and the Iran war scenario is no exception. **Economic uncertainty and inflation** also remain supportive: multi-year high inflation and worries about fiat currency stability have bolstered gold’s appeal as a hedge ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8c06632a309a3a84442360921d6e2a86#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%20%28AP%29%20,what%20you%20need%20to%20know)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8c06632a309a3a84442360921d6e2a86#:~:text=Among%20sources%20of%20uncertainty%20today,fears%20about%20the%20future%20worldwide)). Furthermore, **unprecedented central bank buying** has created a strong underlying bid. Central banks globally (led by China, Russia, Turkey and others) have been accumulating gold at record levels since 2022, seeking to diversify reserves amid a less stable geopolitical order ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2024-09-03/la-tension-geopolitica-dispara-la-compra-de-oro-de-los-bancos-centrales.html#:~:text=2024,La)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=alcanz%C3%B3%20las%204.974%20toneladas%20%28%2B1,500)). These official purchases – over 1,000 tonnes per year in 2022 and 2023 ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=alcanz%C3%B3%20las%204.974%20toneladas%20%28%2B1,500)) – have helped propel gold upward, providing a floor under the market.

Historically, gold has a track record of strength during Middle East conflicts, though often with a “buy the rumor, sell the news” pattern. For example, in the **1990-91 Gulf War** gold initially spiked (rising from the mid-$350s to around $400 in late 1990), but by the end of 1991 it had retreated to roughly pre-conflict levels (~$350) ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=After%20the%201991%20war%2C%20gold,And%2C%20although%20it)). During the **2003 Iraq War**, gold surged in the run-up to hostilities – peaking around $388/oz in early February 2003, a multi-year high ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=Gold%20had%20a%20remarkable%20start,in%20New%20York%20and%20Tokyo)) – then sold off sharply once the U.S. invasion began and a quick victory seemed likely ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=But%20the%20onset%20of%20military,disturbingly%20pessimistic%20purchasing%20manager%20surveys)). A similar dynamic played out in **January 2020** when U.S.-Iran tensions flared after the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani: gold jumped to 7-year highs near $1,600 on safe-haven flows ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2020/01/06/markets-iraq-iran-trump-soleimani-oil#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20gold%20hit,three%20months%20against%20the%20yen)), but the rally proved short-lived once immediate fears of a wider war receded ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2020/01/06/markets-iraq-iran-trump-soleimani-oil#:~:text=Yes%2C%20but%3A%20While%20the%20war,Go%20deeper)). More recently, during the **2023 Hamas–Israel conflict**, gold saw a brief safe-haven bid (climbing toward $2,000 as the war began) amid fears the conflict might widen ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/8c06632a309a3a84442360921d6e2a86#:~:text=Among%20sources%20of%20uncertainty%20today,fears%20about%20the%20future%20worldwide)). However, when that war remained regionally contained, gold’s ascent leveled off and partially reversed as risk sentiment stabilized. These episodes illustrate that gold often *prices in* worst-case scenarios ahead of conflicts, then pulls back if the outcome seems contained or better-than-feared ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=But%20the%20onset%20of%20military,disturbingly%20pessimistic%20purchasing%20manager%20surveys)) ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=After%20the%201991%20war%2C%20gold,And%2C%20although%20it)).

**How much upside is realistic in a full-scale Iran war scenario?** Given that gold is already above $5k, further gains would likely depend on the war’s scope and global impact. In an all-out Iran vs. U.S./Israel war (potentially drawing in proxies and disrupting oil supplies), analysts see scope for *additional* upside but note much may be priced in. Some major banks have offered lofty scenarios: Goldman Sachs had earlier projected gold could reach ~$3,700 in 2025 ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=alcanz%C3%B3%20las%204.974%20toneladas%20%28%2B1,500)), and Bank of America famously lifted its 2026 forecast to $5,000 as prices surged in late 2025 ([www.advisorperspectives.com](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/commentaries/2025/10/16/bank-of-america-ups-gold-price-5-000?topic=global-markets#:~:text=Bank%20of%20America%20Ups%202026,Gold%20Price%20Forecast%20to%20%245%2C000)). Those targets have now been met or exceeded. Any *new* war-driven upside targets center around technical projections (e.g. ~$5,500 per ounce in a momentum spike) ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/gold-5-500-surge-tactical-play-iran-escalation-catalyst-2601/#:~:text=Gold%27s%20%245%2C500%20Surge%3A%20A%20Tactical,Speaker%202%20AI%20Podcast%3AYour%20News)) ([sg.finance.yahoo.com](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=Gold%20prices%20rise%20as%20investors,February%20Vicky%20McKeever%20%C2%B7%20Business)), but banks caution that **gains from here may be more measured**. In a recent outlook, ING analysts note that while risks are *skewed to the upside*, gold’s rally has been so sharp that additional advances might be more gradual unless the conflict dramatically escalates ([malaysia.news.yahoo.com](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=,central%E2%80%91bank%20demand%20are%20underpinning%20prices)). Put differently, a protracted Iran war could see gold grind higher toward $5,500 or even $6,000 in a tail-risk scenario, but a lot of geopolitical risk is already reflected in the current $5k+ price.

Another major driver is the **surge in central bank gold buying**. Since 2022, central banks have been accumulating gold at the fastest pace on record ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2024-09-03/la-tension-geopolitica-dispara-la-compra-de-oro-de-los-bancos-centrales.html#:~:text=2024,La)). This trend has intensified in the face of war risks and geopolitical fragmentation. Nations like China, Turkey, Russia, India, and Middle Eastern countries have vastly expanded reserves to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-closer-06cf9960-f563-11ee-8058-e35dd399455c#:~:text=2024,particularly%20from%20China%2C%20which%20added)). Central bank purchases tripled after 2021, hitting multi-decade highs in 2022 and 2023 ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2024-09-03/la-tension-geopolitica-dispara-la-compra-de-oro-de-los-bancos-centrales.html#:~:text=centrales%20cincodias,La)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2024-09-03/la-tension-geopolitica-dispara-la-compra-de-oro-de-los-bancos-centrales.html#:~:text=2024,La)). Through 2024 and into 2025, these buyers remained net purchasers of over 1,000 tons per year ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=alcanz%C3%B3%20las%204.974%20toneladas%20%28%2B1,500)), helping propel gold’s climb. Notably, China’s often-secretive buying has been a game-changer – analysts suspect China’s true gold holdings are far higher than officially reported, contributing significantly to the 40% gold price surge seen in 2025 ([elpais.com](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-11-24/las-compras-secretas-de-china-impulsan-el-precio-del-oro-un-40.html#:~:text=2025,304%20toneladas%2C%20analistas)). In the current environment, continued central bank demand provides a strong backstop for gold. It also signals a loss of confidence in the dollar-centric world order ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2024/10/22/record-gold-purchases-are-linked-to-a-loss-of-confidence-in-the-us-s-ability-to-influence-the-world-order_6730128_19.html#:~:text=2024,institutions%20celebrate%20the%20legacy%20in)) – a narrative amplified by a U.S./Iran conflict, which could further motivate countries to diversify reserves. In summary, **gold’s jump to $5,200/oz** reflects a perfect storm of war-driven safe-haven demand, high inflation and loose monetary expectations (markets anticipate rate cuts amid the turmoil ([theweek.com](https://theweek.com/business/markets/what-a-rising-gold-price-says-about-the-global-economy#:~:text=economy%20theweek,rate%20fears%2C%20and%20a%20potential))), and relentless central bank buying. The market is in uncharted territory, and while further upside is conceivable if the war expands, much of the *risk premium* is already embedded at these record prices. 

## Gold Mining Stocks vs. Gold ETFs – Leverage and Fundamentals

With gold at stratospheric highs, investors can gain exposure either via **mining equities** or **physical-backed ETFs**, and the trade-offs have become pronounced. **Gold mining stocks** offer leveraged upside to the gold price – historically, miners tend to *outperform* the metal in a rising gold market because their earnings increase exponentially as gold prices rise ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=normally%20see%20their%20stock%20prices,top%20of%20gold%20price%20trends)). On the other hand, **gold ETFs** (like GLD, IAU, SGOL), which track physical gold, provide more direct and lower-risk exposure to gold’s price without company-specific risks. As we evaluate the two approaches, key considerations include valuation metrics, cost profiles, and performance betas:

- **Performance Leverage:** Gold miners typically amplify gold’s moves by roughly *2× to 3×*. This leverage reflects both the fixed-cost nature of mining (higher gold prices mostly drop to the bottom line) and the added operational risk investors bear ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=normally%20see%20their%20stock%20prices,top%20of%20gold%20price%20trends)). We’ve seen this in the current bull run – for example, in the year-to-date rally through early 2025, gold was up ~23%, but many mining stocks jumped 50%+ in the same period ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=acciones%20de%20la%20minera,es%20la%20sudafricana)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L86%20Barrick%20Gold,Los%20inversores%20deber%C3%A1n)). Some miners have far outpaced the metal: Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) rose ~60% over a stretch when gold gained ~23% ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=acciones%20de%20la%20minera,es%20la%20sudafricana)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=solo%20HSBC%20acaba%20de%20rebajar,Eagle%20Mines%2C%20que%20sube%20en)), and Kinross Gold doubled (+62% YTD at one point) versus gold’s more modest rise ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=acciones%20de%20la%20minera,es%20la%20sudafricana)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L86%20Barrick%20Gold,Los%20inversores%20deber%C3%A1n)). This confirms that miners *can* significantly outperform gold in bull phases. However, not all miners participate equally – company-specific factors matter. During 2024–25, for instance, industry leader Barrick Gold lagged some peers, gaining ~33% in one rally, less than a 2× multiple of gold’s move ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L86%20Barrick%20Gold,Los%20inversores%20deber%C3%A1n)) (likely due to cost issues and production shortfalls). Still, as a group, miners have delivered outsized returns relative to gold, rewarding investors who accepted higher volatility.

- **Valuations and Earnings:** The surge in gold to $5k has radically improved miners’ financial metrics. **Profit margins are at record highs** – current gold prices are many times above most miners’ costs. The top producers have all-in sustaining costs (AISC) generally in the ~$1,200–$1,600/oz range ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/newmont-aisc-signals-strong-cost-discipline-sustained-2507/#:~:text=,B%29%20saw%20a)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/barrick-minings-surging-aisc-drag-time-reassess-cost-curve#:~:text=the%20need%20for%20more%20aggressive,spending%20and%20higher%20labor%20and)), which means at $5,200 gold they are generating *bonanza* levels of free cash flow. For example, Newmont Corporation’s AISC is around $1,550–$1,600/oz ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/newmont-aisc-signals-strong-cost-discipline-sustained-2507/#:~:text=,B%29%20saw%20a)), and Barrick projects AISC in the $1,460–$1,560 range for 2025 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/barrick-minings-surging-aisc-drag-time-reassess-cost-curve#:~:text=the%20need%20for%20more%20aggressive,spending%20and%20higher%20labor%20and)). At current prices, that implies operating margins of **~70%** per ounce – a dramatic expansion of profitability. Even if input costs (fuel, labor, etc.) have risen somewhat in recent years, the cost increase is nowhere near the fourfold increase in gold price since the 2010s. As a result, miners are reporting **record earnings and cash flows**. Many are using the windfall to strengthen balance sheets (paying down debt), increase dividends, or invest in new projects. Despite these strong fundamentals, equity valuations have not fully caught up. **P/E multiples and EV/EBITDA ratios for gold miners remain moderate**, as investors are skeptical whether $5k gold is sustainable. This skepticism has led to a valuation disconnect – as of early 2026, gold stocks still trade at relatively low multiples given their earnings potential ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=The%20gold%20miners%E2%80%99%20stock%20prices,to%20reflect%20their%20record%20earnings)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=shocking%20valuation%20anomaly%2C%20with%20gold,to%20reflect%20their%20record%20earnings)). Analysts have called this a “valuation anomaly,” noting that gold miner share prices in 2024 lagged far behind the metal’s rise ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=The%20gold%20miners%E2%80%99%20stock%20prices,to%20reflect%20their%20record%20earnings)). That gap began to close in 2025 as more investors rotated into miners, but many stocks still look inexpensive relative to current gold prices. For instance, Newmont and Barrick both trade around mid-teens forward P/E, and under 1.2× Net Asset Value (P/NAV), which is cheap by historical standards for peak-cycle profits. In short, mining stocks offer **deep value** if one believes gold prices will remain elevated – they provide much greater earnings yield than holding the metal via an ETF, albeit with added risks.

- **Cost Structures (AISC) and Margins:** As noted, **All-in Sustaining Costs** for senior gold miners range roughly from $1,200 to $1,600 per ounce. Agnico Eagle (AEM) is among the lowest-cost senior producers – its AISC has been *peer-leading*, around the low end of that range or below, owing to high-grade assets and efficient operations ([agnicoeagle.com](https://agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2026/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-QUARTERLY-AND-ANNUAL-FREE-CASH-FLOW-2025-PRODUCTION-GUIDANCE-ACHIEVED-TOTAL-2025-SHAREHOLDER-RETURNS-OF-1-4-BILLION-DIVIDEND-INCREASED-BY-12-5-UPDATED-THREE-YEAR-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=New%20Three,5%20million%20ounces%20annually%20in)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=solo%20HSBC%20acaba%20de%20rebajar,Eagle%20Mines%2C%20que%20sube%20en)). Barrick and Newmont have slightly higher cost profiles (upper end of the range), partly due to some lower-grade mines and inflationary pressures. Industry-wide, average AISC hit a record high around $1,300 in 2023 as energy and labor costs climbed ([www.gold.org](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/gold-focus/2023/07/gold-miners-average-aisc-resumes-rising-trend-in-q1-23-and-reaches-new-record-high#:~:text=Gold%20miners%E2%80%99%20average%20AISC%20resumes,Follow%20on)). Companies responded by cutting costs where possible, but some inflation (diesel, materials, etc.) is unavoidable – for example, Barrick’s AISC jumped ~20% year-over-year in early 2025 due to higher input costs and lower production ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/barrick-minings-surging-aisc-drag-time-reassess-cost-curve#:~:text=Barrick%20Mining%20Corporation%20B%20is,containment%20strategies%20to%20maintain)). Still, at $5k gold, whether a miner’s AISC is $1,200 or $1,600, the margins are extraordinary. **Profit leverage** is evident: each $100 increase above AISC goes straight to operating profit. So a miner like AEM with an AISC near $1,200 is enjoying ~$4,000/oz margin (over 3× the cost), whereas a higher-cost miner at $1,600 AISC still sees ~$3,600/oz margin. This means even traditionally “marginal” mines are hugely profitable at current prices, and low-cost operations are veritable cash cows. Notably, **streaming/royalty companies** (like Wheaton Precious Metals) have an even lower cost base – often paying a fixed $400–$500/oz for gold or ~$4–$5/oz for silver in their streaming agreements – giving them exposure to price upside with minimal operating costs. We’ll discuss WPM separately, but their *asset-light* model yields extremely high margins at $5k gold (with virtually no cost inflation risk).

- **Historical Beta vs Gold:** The **beta** (sensitivity) of miners to gold is well documented. As mentioned, a 1% move in gold might translate to ~2–3% move in mining stocks on average ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=normally%20see%20their%20stock%20prices,top%20of%20gold%20price%20trends)). The **Gold Miners ETF (GDX)** has traditionally provided about 1.5–2.0× leverage to gold price changes. However, during periods of extreme stress or equity market sell-offs, this relationship can break down. For instance, if a war panic causes a broad stock market decline, gold bullion could rise even as mining equities fall, at least temporarily, because miners are stocks that can be sold off in a risk-off wave. We saw hints of this in shorter conflict scares – gold often gets an immediate safe-haven bid, whereas miners might lag if equity investors are fleeing to cash. Over multi-month periods though, sustained higher gold prices tend to filter through to higher mining stock prices, usually with amplified gains. Recent performance bears this out: from the start of 2025 to now, gold’s price roughly doubled, while indices like the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index have more than doubled (with many individual miners up 3× or more from late-2023 levels) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=acciones%20de%20la%20minera,es%20la%20sudafricana)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L86%20Barrick%20Gold,Los%20inversores%20deber%C3%A1n)). In summary, miners *do* outperform in gold bull markets, but with more volatility. Their beta to gold is roughly 2:1, though it can be higher for small caps or companies with operational gearing (e.g., high fixed costs or new projects). This leverage cuts both ways – if gold prices were to pull back, mining stocks could fall significantly more in percentage terms.

- **Company Fundamentals – Growth, Risks, Balance Sheets:** Within the gold mining sector, quality and strategy diverge widely. **Production growth** is an important differentiator. Some majors are struggling just to maintain production levels, while others have growth projects in the pipeline. For example, Newmont (after its 2023 acquisition of Newcrest Mining ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/11/newmont-sweetens-its-golden-megamerger-offer-for-newcrest#:~:text=2023,offer%20made%20in%20February%2C%20which))) is now the world’s largest gold producer with an annual output around ~8 million oz, but its growth is largely acquisitive; organically, Newmont’s production is relatively flat with a focus on replacing reserves. Barrick Gold has outlined growth projects (including expansions in Nevada, Latin America, and Africa) aiming to lift its output from ~4.5 million oz toward 5+ million in coming years. However, execution has been mixed – issues at some mines (like the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali, which faced disruptions ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/barrick-minings-surging-aisc-drag-time-reassess-cost-curve#:~:text=critical%20cost%20metric%20for%20miners,1%2C560%20per%20ounce.%20These))) have slowed Barrick’s progress. **Agnico Eagle** has a strong growth-through-exploration track record – after merging with Kirkland Lake in 2022, AEM has a stable production base ~3.4 million oz/yr and is investing in incremental expansions (for example, the new Odyssey underground mine at Canadian Malartic in Quebec). Agnico’s production profile is steady with modest growth, but importantly it has *one of the lowest geopolitical risk profiles*: nearly all its mines are in politically stable, mining-friendly countries (Canada, Australia, Finland, Mexico) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=solo%20HSBC%20acaba%20de%20rebajar,Eagle%20Mines%2C%20que%20sube%20en)). This greatly reduces the risk of geopolitical disruptions (a key consideration if one is worried about war-related instability). **Balance sheets** across the major miners are generally strong at this point. Years of high prices have allowed debt reduction. Agnico Eagle shines here – it has **minimal net debt** (net debt ~$200 million, essentially near zero for a company its size) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L77%20Bolsa%20en,reducida%20en%20el%20%C3%BAltimo%20a%C3%B1o)), giving it flexibility and lower financial risk. Barrick and Newmont also have manageable debt levels and ample liquidity; Barrick in particular made debt reduction a priority in recent years. All three majors have investment-grade credit and have been returning capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. In terms of **geopolitical risk**, Agnico (with its concentration in G7 countries) is best-in-class. Newmont and Barrick have broader global exposure – Newmont operates in jurisdictions like Ghana, Peru, Suriname, and Argentina, while Barrick has significant operations in Africa (Mali, DRC, Tanzania) and the Middle East (it has a JV in Pakistan and projects in Saudi Arabia). These can carry higher geopolitical or security risks, though they also offer rich geological prospects. Investors may favor the “safer” jurisdiction companies (AEM, and to an extent Newmont) in a conflict scenario to avoid compounding war risk with country risk.

- **Gold Mining Stocks vs ETFs – Investment Case:** Choosing miners vs gold ETFs depends on one’s risk tolerance and outlook. **Gold ETFs** (like SPDR Gold Shares – GLD) are essentially a *pure play* on the metal’s price. They have *low risk* in the sense that there’s no operational company risk – you’re not worried about a mining accident, cost overruns, or CEO decisions; you simply get gold’s price performance (minus a small management fee). In a war-driven scenario, if you expect **short-term turmoil** and just want safe-haven exposure, an ETF is a straightforward, liquid vehicle. However, ETFs won’t *outperform* the metal – they just match it. **Mining stocks** introduce company-specific risks but offer that juicy leverage to gold’s upside. If one believes $5k+ gold will persist or rise further, miners could provide significantly higher returns than gold itself, as their earnings and potential dividends explode. Additionally, many gold miners pay dividends (often linked to gold price levels), which can outstrip the negligible yield of holding physical gold. For instance, Newmont and Barrick have dividend policies that flex with gold prices; at $5k gold, their dividend yields have become quite attractive (some on the order of 4–5% annually, adding a nice income component to returns). The flip side is **volatility** – mining stocks can swing wildly, and if gold prices collapse or a mine gets shut down, the stocks can severely underperform. **Bottom line:** Gold ETFs are a simpler, lower-vol way to get safe-haven exposure. Gold mining stocks are more speculative but can **amplify gains** and may even be *undervalued* currently relative to gold’s run (providing a margin of safety if one believes gold will stay high) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=The%20gold%20miners%E2%80%99%20stock%20prices,to%20reflect%20their%20record%20earnings)). Many analysts suggest holding a mix: a core position in physical or ETFs for stability, and a selection of the best-quality miners for leveraged upside.

- **Juniors & Mid-Tiers:** Beyond the big three miners, there are mid-tier producers and royalty companies worth consideration. **Kinross Gold (KGC)**, for example, has restructured after selling its high-risk Russian assets in 2022. It now focuses on mines in the Americas and West Africa and has benefited from the gold price upswing (its stock up ~60% in 2025) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L86%20Barrick%20Gold,Los%20inversores%20deber%C3%A1n)). While Kinross carries a bit more geopolitical risk (mines in Mauritania, etc.), it trades at a discount and offers torque if one is comfortable with medium risk. **Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)** and **Franco-Nevada (FNV)** are streaming & royalty companies – a *different animal* in the sector. They don’t operate mines but finance other miners in exchange for a cut of production. This model yields very high margins, diversification across many mines, and typically lower operational risk. We will discuss WPM in detail below, but broadly, royalty companies have performed well in this bull market (often hitting all-time highs) as investors prize their steady exposure to gold/silver price upside without mining headaches. **Junior explorers** (small-cap companies looking for new gold deposits) likely won’t be a focus in a war trade idea context, as they’re extremely high risk and dependent on capital markets (which can dry up in crises). For actionable ideas in a war scenario, sticking to producers and well-financed mid-tiers is wiser. One could also consider **sector ETFs** like GDX (gold miners) or GDXJ (junior miners) to get broad exposure without single-company risk. GDX, for instance, holds a basket of major miners and has roughly doubled in the past year, reflecting the sector’s overall leverage to gold. This can be a *compelling option* if you believe the gold rally will continue but don’t want to bet on any one miner’s execution.

## Silver as an Industrial + Safe-Haven Play

**Silver** has also been soaring, though its dynamics differ from gold. Currently, silver trades around **$65–$70 per ounce** (versus ~$18–$20 just a few years ago), reflecting both safe-haven flows and a surge in industrial demand. The **gold-to-silver ratio** (the price of gold divided by silver) stands around the mid-70s to low-80s, which is slightly above historical averages. Gold’s supersized rally initially outpaced silver – at one point in 2025 the ratio was over 85:1 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/54df4547db76db81a58cdf058548b148#:~:text=a,per%20troy%20ounce%20Friday%20morning)) – but silver has since played “catch up.” In fact, in 2025 silver outperformed gold in percentage terms (silver futures jumped ~70% that year, vs ~60% for gold ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/54df4547db76db81a58cdf058548b148#:~:text=Gold%20futures%20are%20up%20nearly,per%20troy%20ounce%20Friday%20morning))). As a result, the gold/silver ratio has compressed from extreme highs, though it remains elevated compared to long-term norms (for reference, the ratio historically averages ~60-70, and in precious metals bull markets silver often rises faster, briefly pushing the ratio down to 40–50). This indicates silver *could* have more room to run if the safe-haven trade continues into a full Iran war scenario – a return to a 60:1 ratio at $5,000 gold would imply ~$83 silver, for example. However, silver’s dual nature means its outlook isn’t as straightforward as gold’s.

Unlike gold, which is driven almost purely by investment and monetary demand, **silver straddles the line between precious metal and industrial commodity**. Roughly half of silver’s demand comes from industrial uses in electronics, solar energy, automotive, and other applications ([metalwealthnow.com](https://metalwealthnow.com/silver/silver-industrial-demand/#:~:text=Silver%27s%20Industrial%20Demand%3A%20Solar%2C%20EVs,Gold%20gets%20the%20glamour%2C%20but)). Silver is essential in **solar panels**, where it’s used in photovoltaic cell contacts – the renewable energy push globally has made the solar industry a major source of silver demand growth ([www.pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/11/13/solar-underpins-record-high-industrial-demand-for-silver/#:~:text=International%20www.pv,It%20expects%20the%20global%20silver)). It’s also used heavily in **electronic components** (contacts, conductors, solder) due to its excellent electrical properties, as well as in high-end **military technology**, medical devices, and even in the production of 5G infrastructure. This means silver’s fate is tied partly to the economic cycle. A war scenario creates two conflicting forces for silver: 

- **Safe-Haven Investment Demand:** In times of crisis, silver (though less of a haven than gold) does attract investment inflows. We’ve seen retail investors dubbed “silver stackers” accumulating coins and bars as a hedge against currency debasement and crisis. Exchange-traded funds like iShares Silver Trust (SLV) have seen rising inflows alongside gold ETFs. During the current geopolitical tensions, silver’s precious metal aspect has led it to rally in tandem with gold (as noted, +70% in 2025) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/54df4547db76db81a58cdf058548b148#:~:text=a,per%20troy%20ounce%20Friday%20morning)). If a full-scale Iran conflict erupts, one can expect **knee-jerk safe-haven buying** of silver as well – especially if gold becomes extremely expensive, some investors may turn to “poor man’s gold.” Additionally, any spillover of conflict that disrupts production of other metals or harms the global economy might spur central banks (though central banks typically don’t buy silver) and the public to put more wealth into hard assets including silver.

- **Industrial Demand Factors:** On the other hand, an Iran war could **dampen industrial demand** for silver in the short to medium term. A large Middle East war would likely send oil prices soaring and could tip the global economy toward recession or at least stagflation. If industrial activity and consumer spending contract, sectors like electronics and solar could see slower growth or temporary pullbacks in demand. For example, if global automobile or electronics sales slump in a war-induced recession, silver usage in those products would dip. The solar industry might be somewhat less affected (since energy security concerns could actually boost renewables investment longer-term), but in a severe economic downturn, even renewable energy projects can face delays. There’s also the factor of **military spending** – modern warfare uses high-tech weaponry and systems that include silver (for example, in communications equipment and guided missiles). A protracted conflict could increase demand for certain military electronics. However, that’s a relatively small component compared to overall industrial use. So the net industrial impact of war is ambiguous: initially likely negative due to broad economic strain, but potentially followed by policy responses (stimulus for green energy, etc.) that support industrial metals.

In previous episodes, silver sometimes lags gold when crisis hits (due to that initial industrial demand concern) but then can **spike dramatically** once monetary/investment drivers take over. In the 1970s, for example, silver eventually vastly outpaced gold’s gains during the inflation crises. In the present case, silver’s price breaking above its long-time nominal ceiling of ~$50 (reached in 1980 and 2011) is a significant bullish milestone ([moneyweek.com](https://moneyweek.com/investments/silver-and-other-precious-metals/how-to-profit-from-silvers-record-rise#:~:text=2025,market%20is%20facing%20a%20severe)). As of late 2025, silver decisively surpassed $50, entering “uncharted territory” technically ([moneyweek.com](https://moneyweek.com/investments/silver-and-other-precious-metals/how-to-profit-from-silvers-record-rise#:~:text=2025,market%20is%20facing%20a%20severe)). Momentum and technical breakouts could carry it higher if conditions remain supportive. 

**Key silver stocks and ETFs:** For exposure to silver, investors have a few avenues:
- **SLV (iShares Silver Trust):** This is the largest silver ETF, physically backed by silver. It’s analogous to GLD for gold. SLV offers direct price exposure with low expense ratio. It is a straightforward way to play silver as a commodity, without company risk. At current silver prices (around $70/oz), SLV trades in the high double-digits (each share roughly corresponds to 1 ounce of silver, so ~$65–$70 per share). SLV’s trading liquidity is excellent, making it a popular vehicle for both long-term holders and short-term traders.
- **Silver Miners**: Major primary silver mining companies include **Pan American Silver (PAAS)**, **First Majestic Silver (AG)**, and **Fortuna Silver Mines (FSM)**, among others. Notably, many so-called “silver miners” actually get a substantial portion of revenue from gold or base metals, since pure silver deposits are rarer. For instance, Pan American Silver, one of the largest, produces silver across mines in Latin America but also significant gold (especially after its 2023 acquisition of Yamana’s assets). PAAS currently benefits from higher silver and gold prices and has a diversified production profile across Canada, Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. **First Majestic (AG)** is a more pure-play Mexican silver miner highly levered to silver prices, popular with retail investors (it has relatively higher costs and thus acts as a high-beta play on silver – when silver prices spike, AG’s profits improve drastically, but it’s riskier if silver falls below their breakeven). **Pan American’s AISC** for silver (net of by-products) is in the mid-teens $/oz, so at $70 silver their margins are huge. First Majestic’s costs are a bit higher (it has had AISC closer to ~$17–18/oz in the past), so $70 silver turns it from marginal to very profitable. 
- **SIL ETF (Global X Silver Miners ETF):** This ETF holds a basket of global silver mining stocks. It includes not just primary silver miners like PAAS and First Majestic, but also companies like Wheaton Precious (streaming company with large silver exposure) and some Latin American and Chinese miners. SIL provides broad exposure to the space, smoothing out single-company risk. It has likely more than doubled in the past year given silver’s move.
- **Streaming/Royalty companies:** **Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM)**, while technically a diversified precious metals streamer, has its roots in silver and still has significant silver streams (notably from mines like Peñasquito in Mexico and Salobo in Brazil). WPM’s model gives it a fixed low cost, so it benefits immensely from rising silver (and gold) prices. Another is **Franco-Nevada (FNV)** – also diversified but with silver in its portfolio. These tend to trade at higher valuations (investors pay a premium for their lower risk), but they are a way to get silver exposure with less operational volatility.

**Would an Iran war boost or hurt silver?** In the immediate term, an Iran war likely **boosts silver’s investment demand** (hence price) due to fear and uncertainty – much as it does gold. But if the conflict causes a global economic shock (say a deep recession or financial crisis), there could be periods where silver’s industrial linkage drags it down relative to gold. For example, if equity markets crash or manufacturing slumps, silver could temporarily underperform gold (as happened in 2008, when silver fell harder than gold during the liquidity crunch). Already, we see that silver’s run to $70 has been partly driven by optimism about industrial usage (solar investment, etc.) as well as safe-haven flows. If war-driven oil spikes slow the solar rollout due to higher costs or budget pressures, that narrative could cool. Conversely, sustained high oil prices could spur **even more investment in renewable energy (solar)** as countries seek energy independence, which would *increase medium-term demand* for silver in photovoltaics. Military demand for silver (for electronics) might tick up, but it’s not large enough to be a major price driver. Another factor: many silver mines are by-products of base metal mines (lead, zinc). If a war disrupts base metal mining or trade (for instance, if sanctions or conflict impact countries that produce copper, lead, zinc – Iran itself isn’t a major base metals producer, but a broader conflict could indirectly affect mining in regions due to higher energy prices or instability), silver supply might actually tighten (since less base metal production means less silver byproduct output). This supply angle could support prices as well.

**Silver stock valuations:** Similar to gold miners, silver equities’ valuations have improved (earnings up, some multiple expansion) but aren’t overly stretched. Many silver miners entered this bull market with depressed stock prices after years of languishing; thus, even after doubling or tripling, some still trade at reasonable multiples of cash flow. Pan American, for instance, has a diversified asset base and with metal prices up, its forward P/E is still in low double digits. First Majestic tends to trade more on sentiment (often at a premium during silver rallies thanks to retail interest). The *risk with silver stocks* is higher volatility – they swing more wildly than gold stocks typically, because silver itself is more volatile. **Costs structures** for silver miners vary widely. Some operations, especially those with by-product credits, can claim very low or even negative cash costs for silver (if their zinc/lead output revenue offsets costs). Others that are pure plays have higher nominal costs. But across the industry, at $65–$70 silver, virtually every primary silver miner is comfortably profitable. This was not the case at $20 silver (where many struggled), so the war-driven price surge has *rescued* marginal projects and turned them lucrative.

In summary, silver provides a *higher beta* play on the crisis. It offers safe-haven characteristics, plus a stake in industrial recovery or trends (like solar) post-crisis. An Iran war initially injects upside risk for silver (as a quasi-safe haven), but one must watch the industrial dynamic. For trade ideas, pairing a gold position with a bit of silver could diversify the bet – gold may outperform if things get very dire (flight to quality), but silver could outperform if the post-shock environment includes robust stimulus or if inflation runs hot (silver historically performs very well in inflationary booms). 

## Specific Trade Recommendations – Gold & Silver Plays

Below we present **actionable trade ideas** for key tickers in the Gold/Precious Metals sector. Each “trade card” includes the current price (late Feb 2026), an investment thesis, price targets, risks, and our risk/reward assessment:

### NEM – Newmont Corp. (Largest Gold Miner)

- **Current Price (Feb 2026):** ~$90 per share (Newmont stock has roughly doubled in the past year amid surging gold prices).  
- **Thesis:** Newmont is the world’s largest gold producer, offering unparalleled leverage to gold’s price. With gold at $5k+, Newmont is generating record cash flows. The company’s recent acquisition of Newcrest (completed in 2023) expanded its production and added high-quality assets in Australia and Canada ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/11/newmont-sweetens-its-golden-megamerger-offer-for-newcrest#:~:text=2023,offer%20made%20in%20February%2C%20which)). Now Newmont produces ~8 million ounces of gold annually, plus significant copper, giving it diversification. At current prices, Newmont’s operating margins are enormous – AISC is around $1,550/oz ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/newmont-aisc-signals-strong-cost-discipline-sustained-2507/#:~:text=,B%29%20saw%20a)), so at $5,200 gold the profit per ounce is over 3× costs. This cash is being used to hike dividends and buy back shares; Newmont has a policy of returning cash to shareholders as gold prices rise. Importantly for a war scenario, Newmont offers *scale and stability* – it has a diverse global portfolio (North America, Australia, Africa, South America) which mitigates any single mine risk. The stock remains attractive on valuation: despite the price doubling, it trades at perhaps ~12× forward earnings, which is reasonable given the gold price windfall (many still aren’t fully pricing $5k gold as sustainable ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=The%20gold%20miners%E2%80%99%20stock%20prices,to%20reflect%20their%20record%20earnings))). In an Iran war-driven gold spike, Newmont could be a prime beneficiary as institutional money flows into the “safest” and largest miner.
- **Upside Target:** **$110** (approx. 20% upside) in a full-scale conflict scenario. This target is based on further multiple expansion to ~15× earnings and/or additional gold price upside to ~$6,000 (which could drive NEM higher). Historically, in strong gold bull markets, Newmont has traded at premium multiples and made new highs. If gold goes parabolic beyond $5k, NEM stock could revisit those dynamics. Some analysts have price targets in the $100+ range already, and a breakout war could induce another leg up.  
- **Downside Target:** **$75** (about 17% downside). This would be the scenario where war fears ease or gold corrects toward ~$4,000. Newmont shares might pull back given their recent big run. $75 is around the stock’s breakout support and would still be ~50% higher than its level a year ago. Even at $4k gold, Newmont is enormously profitable, so we see downside as somewhat cushioned – but sentiment could cause a short-term overshoot to the downside if gold really slumps or the market sells off broadly.  
- **Key Risks:** (1) **Gold Price Decline** – Newmont’s fortunes are tied to gold; if peace suddenly breaks out or global liquidity issues force gold down, NEM will drop. (2) **Operational setbacks** – Newmont has had occasional issues at mines (e.g., a strike at its Peñasquito mine in Mexico in 2023 disrupted production). Any mine shutdowns, accidents, or project delays could hit earnings. (3) **Geopolitical/local risks** – While diversified, Newmont operates in some higher-risk locales (e.g., Ghana, where political or social unrest could occur). War in the Middle East doesn’t directly threaten its mines, but second-order effects (energy prices, supply chain) could impact operations. (4) **Integration risk** – Post-Newcrest acquisition, Newmont needs to smoothly integrate those assets; any hiccups (like cost overruns or cultural clashes) could weigh on performance.  
- **Risk Level:** **Medium.** Newmont is one of the lower-risk gold equities due to scale and diversification, but it’s still an equity sensitive to gold’s volatile price and mining risks. We consider it a relatively stable pick within a high-risk sector.  
- **Conviction:** **High.** As a top-tier gold producer with strong management and leverage to $5k gold, we have high conviction that NEM will outperform if the Iran war scenario keeps gold elevated. It’s a cornerstone holding for playing the gold theme, suitable for investors who want significant upside with less single-mine risk. 

### GOLD – Barrick Gold Corp. (Global Gold & Copper Miner)

- **Current Price (Feb 2026):** ~$35 per share. (Barrick’s stock has risen, but not as dramatically as some peers, reflecting earlier operational challenges; it’s still below all-time highs, indicating potential value).  
- **Thesis:** Barrick is the world’s second-largest gold miner and also produces substantial copper. The company, led by renowned CEO Mark Bristow, offers broad exposure to gold with a focus on tier-one assets. Barrick’s appeal lies in its improving fundamentals – they have aggressively cut debt in recent years and streamlined operations. War-induced gold prices are a huge tailwind: Barrick’s AISC (~$1,500/oz in 2025 guidance ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/barrick-minings-surging-aisc-drag-time-reassess-cost-curve#:~:text=the%20need%20for%20more%20aggressive,spending%20and%20higher%20labor%20and))) means massive margins at $5k gold, fueling strong free cash flow. They are using cash to fund projects and pay dividends (Barrick has a base + performance dividend structure that could yield ~3-4% at current prices). The stock trades at a discount to Newmont on most metrics, partly due to **perceived higher geopolitical risk** (Barrick has mines in Africa and the Middle East) and some production misses. However, that also means more upside if things go right. Notably, Barrick’s assets in Nevada (USA) and Latin America are significant and in stable regions, offsetting riskier locales. An Iran war scenario benefits Barrick not only via gold but potentially via copper – if the conflict spurs inflation and infrastructure spending, copper prices could rise (Barrick has large copper exposure from assets like Lumwana and Jabal Sayid). Barrick’s stock has **lagged** peers, so it could play “catch up” as investors realize its cash generation potential at $5k gold. 
- **Upside Target:** **$42** (20%+ upside). This assumes Barrick closes some of its valuation gap to Newmont and/or gold runs further. If gold heads towards $5,500 and Barrick demonstrates cost control, the market could re-rate the stock to a higher P/NAV. $42 would be a multi-year high for Barrick, but not unrealistic – it traded at equivalent levels when gold was much lower, so on an EV/EBITDA basis $42 at today’s gold price is still reasonable. Additionally, any resolution of its operational issues (for example, lifting the suspension at Loulo in Mali, or expanding production at key mines) could act as a catalyst.  
- **Downside Target:** **$28**. This might occur if gold pulls back under $4k or if Barrick disappoints on execution. $28 was roughly a support level during 2025; it also correlates to a scenario of slightly compressed margins (if energy costs spike further or a mine issue arises). At $28, Barrick’s valuation would be extremely cheap (likely <10× earnings), but that could happen in a panic or if war fears abate quickly.  
- **Key Risks:** (1) **Operational risk** – Barrick has had some hiccups: rising AISC (up 20% YoY in early 2025) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/barrick-minings-surging-aisc-drag-time-reassess-cost-curve#:~:text=Barrick%20Mining%20Corporation%20B%20is,containment%20strategies%20to%20maintain)) and lower production from certain mines. If they continue to struggle with costs or output (due to technical issues, ore grade declines, etc.), the stock could lag even if gold is high. (2) **Jurisdiction risk** – Barrick has mines in countries that occasionally face turmoil (e.g., Mali had a coup, Papua New Guinea issues in past, etc.). An expanded Middle East conflict or global instability could indirectly affect those regions, or at least scare investors. (3) **Copper price fluctuations** – While copper is a smaller part of Barrick’s revenue, a severe global recession from war could soften copper demand, partially offsetting gold gains. (4) **Stronger USD/interest rates** – If the war somehow leads to surging U.S. dollar or bond yields (perhaps due to Fed response to inflation), gold might be capped, pressuring Barrick’s outlook.  
- **Risk Level:** **Medium-High.** Barrick carries a bit more risk than Newmont/Agnico due to its geographic spread and recent operational issues. There’s also a bit more *turnaround execution* needed (e.g., hitting production targets). However, it’s still a large-cap miner with a strong balance sheet and diversified asset base, so not as risky as junior miners.  
- **Conviction:** **Medium-High.** We believe Barrick is a compelling play for upside catch-up. Our conviction is bolstered by its underperformance – it has more room to run if gold stays high. But we temper that with operational caution: one should monitor Barrick’s quarterly results to ensure costs are controlled. Overall, we like it as a slightly contrarian pick among the majors, with a favorable risk/reward if one expects a lasting gold bull market from war disruptions.

### AEM – Agnico Eagle Mines (High-Quality Gold Miner)

- **Current Price (Feb 2026):** ~$120 per share. (Agnico’s stock has been a standout, significantly outperforming many peers thanks to its quality assets and strong results – it’s up roughly 3× from its 2023 levels).  
- **Thesis:** Agnico Eagle is often considered **best-of-breed** among gold miners for its combination of low geopolitical risk, operational excellence, and growth potential. The company operates primarily in **safe jurisdictions** – Canada, Australia, Finland, with some operations in Mexico – insulating it from much of the geopolitical turbulence that can affect other miners. In a war scenario, this is invaluable: investors gravitate to Agnico for its stability. After the 2022 merger with Kirkland Lake, AEM has a robust production profile around 3.3–3.5 million oz per year and improved grades. Its assets like Detour Lake and Fosterville (formerly Kirkland’s crown jewels) are world-class, high-margin mines. Agnico’s **cost profile** is among the lowest: AISC is peer-leading, roughly in the low $1,200s per ounce (co-product basis) for many mines ([agnicoeagle.com](https://agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2026/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-QUARTERLY-AND-ANNUAL-FREE-CASH-FLOW-2025-PRODUCTION-GUIDANCE-ACHIEVED-TOTAL-2025-SHAREHOLDER-RETURNS-OF-1-4-BILLION-DIVIDEND-INCREASED-BY-12-5-UPDATED-THREE-YEAR-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=New%20Three,5%20million%20ounces%20annually%20in)). That yields tremendous margins at $5k gold. Uniquely, Agnico has **very low debt** – as of the end of 2025 it was nearly in a net cash position ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L77%20Bolsa%20en,reducida%20en%20el%20%C3%BAltimo%20a%C3%B1o)) – giving it flexibility to increase dividends (which it has, boosting payouts by 12.5% for 2025) ([agnicoeagle.com](https://agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2026/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-QUARTERLY-AND-ANNUAL-FREE-CASH-FLOW-2025-PRODUCTION-GUIDANCE-ACHIEVED-TOTAL-2025-SHAREHOLDER-RETURNS-OF-1-4-BILLION-DIVIDEND-INCREASED-BY-12-5-UPDATED-THREE-YEAR-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=Agnico%20Eagle%20Mines%20Limited%20,YEAR%20GUIDANCE)) ([www.agnicoeagle.com](https://www.agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2026/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-QUARTERLY-AND-ANNUAL-FREE-CASH-FLOW-2025-PRODUCTION-GUIDANCE-ACHIEVED-TOTAL-2025-SHAREHOLDER-RETURNS-OF-1-4-BILLION-DIVIDEND-INCREASED-BY-12-5-UPDATED-THREE-YEAR-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=Agnico%20Eagle%20Mines%20Limited%20,YEAR%20GUIDANCE)) or pursue organic growth. The company is also known for a strong corporate culture and solid relationships in the communities where it operates (less risk of strikes or disputes). For an investor, AEM offers a “sleep at night” gold equity: you get the leverage to gold’s upside, but with fewer nasty surprises. In the current context, Agnico is firing on all cylinders – recent results showed record free cash flow and production guidance being met/exceeded ([agnicoeagle.com](https://agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2026/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-QUARTERLY-AND-ANNUAL-FREE-CASH-FLOW-2025-PRODUCTION-GUIDANCE-ACHIEVED-TOTAL-2025-SHAREHOLDER-RETURNS-OF-1-4-BILLION-DIVIDEND-INCREASED-BY-12-5-UPDATED-THREE-YEAR-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=Agnico%20Eagle%20Mines%20Limited%20,YEAR%20GUIDANCE)) ([www.agnicoeagle.com](https://www.agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2025/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FIRST-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS---STRONG-QUARTERLY-OPERATIONAL-AND-FINANCIAL-PERFORMANCE-BALANCE-SHEET-FURTHER-STRENGTHENED-BY-STRONG-FREE-CASH-FLOW-GENERATION-16TH-ANNUAL-SUSTAINABILITY-REPORT-RELEASED/default.aspx#:~:text=Agnico%20Eagle%20Mines%20Limited%20,16TH%20ANNUAL%20SUSTAINABILITY%20REPORT%20RELEASED)). If one expects gold to remain elevated or rise further due to war, Agnico should continue to thrive and possibly command an even higher premium. 
- **Upside Target:** **$140**. This would be further price discovery to new all-time highs. $140 implies about 17% upside and would put AEM at a higher P/E multiple, but deservedly so given its low-risk profile. In a sustained war-driven gold rally, investors could bid Agnico up aggressively as a safe haven within miners. Also, any positive news like an exploration success or a friendly acquisition (AEM has historically grown via M&A of quality assets) could add to upside. Given its low share count relative to peers, AEM’s earnings per share at $5k gold are enormous, which could justify a $140+ stock.  
- **Downside Target:** **$100**. If gold pulls back or the market rotates out of miners, Agnico might retrace some gains. $100 (about a 17% drop) would likely be a strong support zone (roughly where it traded in late 2025 during a consolidation). Because of its quality, we suspect AEM would fall less than other miners if gold drops – it tends to be a defensive stock in the sector. Even around $100, it would be ~40% higher than pre-2024 levels, showing how much gold’s rise has re-rated the stock.  
- **Key Risks:** (1) **Gold price risk** – like all miners, if gold falls significantly, AEM’s stock will decline. That said, it has lower breakeven costs, so it’s insulated fundamentally, but sentiment would still hit it. (2) **Limited growth** – one could argue Agnico, by focusing on low-risk jurisdictions, may not have the *highest growth* pipeline compared to a company willing to mine in riskier places. Its production is relatively stable (management guides for flat ~3.3M oz through 2028) ([www.agnicoeagle.com](https://www.agnicoeagle.com/English/news-and-media/news-releases/news-details/2026/AGNICO-EAGLE-REPORTS-FOURTH-QUARTER-AND-FULL-YEAR-2025-RESULTS---RECORD-QUARTERLY-AND-ANNUAL-FREE-CASH-FLOW-2025-PRODUCTION-GUIDANCE-ACHIEVED-TOTAL-2025-SHAREHOLDER-RETURNS-OF-1-4-BILLION-DIVIDEND-INCREASED-BY-12-5-UPDATED-THREE-YEAR-GUIDANCE/default.aspx#:~:text=INCREASED%20BY%2012.5%25%3B%20UPDATED%20THREE,5%20million%20ounces%20annually%20in)). Without big growth, some investors might favor higher beta names if gold keeps soaring. (3) **Operational incident** – any mine can have problems (cave-ins, floods, etc.). Agnico had a great track record, but one cannot rule out unforeseen issues at a major mine. (4) **Valuation premium** – AEM isn’t cheap; it trades at a higher P/NAV and EV/EBITDA than peers due to its quality. In a market downturn, high-valuation stocks can correct more as investors take profits. If sentiment shifts, Agnico’s premium could compress (though we think it’s justified).  
- **Risk Level:** **Medium-Low (for a gold stock).** Among mining equities, Agnico is on the lower-risk end. It’s not immune to market volatility, but its jurisdictional safety and strong financials reduce many typical mining risks. We assign medium-low because it’s still tied to gold prices, but company-specific risk is low.  
- **Conviction:** **High.** Agnico Eagle is a top pick in the gold sector for a war scenario. We have high conviction that it offers an excellent risk/reward – you get significant upside if gold runs, with less downside if things calm down (since AEM would likely hold value better thanks to its quality). It’s a core holding type of stock for exposure to gold, ideal for more conservative investors who still want leverage to the theme.

### GLD – SPDR Gold Shares ETF (Physical Gold Proxy)

- **Current Price (Feb 2026):** ~$500 per share. (GLD tracks 1/10th of an ounce of gold approximately, so with spot gold around $5,200, GLD is just over $500).  
- **Thesis:** GLD is the simplest, most direct way to invest in gold without holding physical bullion. In the context of war and geopolitical turmoil, GLD serves as a relatively *low-risk safe haven*. The ETF is backed by physical gold in vaults, so its price moves in lockstep with spot gold. The current environment of war fears, high inflation, and central bank buying is exactly the scenario where holding gold makes sense – and GLD allows one to do so easily in a brokerage account. The investment case for GLD is straightforward: if you believe gold will maintain its value or rise further due to the Iran-U.S./Israel conflict and related global instability, then GLD should appreciate accordingly. Unlike miners, GLD has *no operational or management risk*. It also has high liquidity and no risk of mispriced NAV (it trades very tight to actual gold value). Another angle: GLD can act as a portfolio diversifier. During times of financial stress (which a major war could induce), gold often inversely correlates with stocks. Having GLD can hedge against a stock market downturn that might accompany the war or its economic fallout. Central banks’ continued buying adds a tailwind – they effectively remove supply from the market, benefiting holders of gold. Additionally, if the U.S. dollar were to weaken (for instance, if war undermines confidence in U.S. finances or if the Fed cuts rates), gold could gain in USD terms, boosting GLD. All said, GLD is a *lower-volatility, high-confidence play* on the crisis theme, ideal for those who want exposure to precious metals without the extra beta of stocks.
- **Upside Target:** **$570** (which would correspond to roughly $5,700/oz gold). This assumes a further 10-15% rise in gold if the war escalates beyond current expectations. It’s plausible under scenarios like a severe supply disruption (oil shock leading to stagflation) or broader conflict drawing in other nations. We note that some bullish analysts are even floating $6,000+ gold if a true global crisis unfolds, which would put GLD > $600. Our $570 target is a moderate upside case within the realm of recent bank forecasts and extension of the technical trend ([m.au.investing.com](https://m.au.investing.com/analysis/gold-trades-in-a-new-range-as-politics-not-inflation-drive-the-bid-200611276?ampMode=1#:~:text=Gold%20Trades%20in%20a%20New,the%20downside%2C%20the%20structure%20is)).  
- **Downside Target:** **$400** (equivalent to ~$4,000/oz gold). This would be a significant pullback, likely requiring a de-escalation of war tensions or an external factor like aggressive monetary tightening. For instance, if a ceasefire or diplomatic deal is reached quickly, the war risk premium in gold could evaporate, sending prices down toward the $4k area where they were in late 2025 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/59ef0a740910042f488609ff471b4334#:~:text=2025,increase)). $400 on GLD also roughly aligns with a strong technical support zone (prior consolidation before the 2025 parabolic move). In a sharper correction (say peace *and* rising real interest rates), a fall to $350 GLD (~$3,500 gold) is conceivable, but we view that as a more extreme case.  
- **Key Risks:** (1) **Quick War Resolution / Peace** – the biggest risk to gold is that the conflict ends swiftly or does not materialize in full. If the feared Iran war is averted or is very short-lived, safe-haven demand could reverse sharply and gold could drop as investors reallocate to risk assets. (2) **Liquidity Crunch** – in a severe financial crisis (possibly triggered by war, e.g. credit events or stock crash), sometimes gold is sold off initially to raise cash (as seen in 2008). GLD could thus dip in the short run if margin calls hit markets, even if the overall thesis is bullish. (3) **USD Strength / Rate Hikes** – if the Federal Reserve responds to war-induced inflation by raising rates aggressively, or if the U.S. dollar surges because global investors flock to U.S. assets, gold’s dollar price might be capped or pressured. A strong dollar and high real yields increase gold’s opportunity cost, potentially weighing on GLD ([malaysia.news.yahoo.com](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=,central%E2%80%91bank%20demand%20are%20underpinning%20prices)). (4) **Already Priced In** – one could argue a lot of bad news is in the price at $5,200/oz. If speculative froth built up, any sentiment shift could cause volatility or corrections in gold.  
- **Risk Level:** **Low.** GLD is considered low-risk in this sector. It’s essentially a commodity holding. There’s no credit risk (aside from the trust structure, which is solid and audited) and no company risk. The main risk is price volatility of gold itself, but gold at least tends not to go to zero or bankrupt like a company might. In a war scenario, GLD is one of the safer assets one can own.  
- **Conviction:** **High.** Owning gold (via GLD) is a high-conviction move in the face of a possible Iran war. We view it as a foundational trade – it’s not about huge outperformance but about reliable protection and upside if things worsen. GLD is a **core holding** for crisis hedge, and we remain firmly bullish on gold’s prospects given the macro backdrop ([malaysia.news.yahoo.com](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=,central%E2%80%91bank%20demand%20are%20underpinning%20prices)). 

### SLV – iShares Silver Trust ETF (Physical Silver Proxy)

- **Current Price (Feb 2026):** ~$65 per share. (SLV reflects the price of silver; with silver near $70/oz, SLV is in the mid-$60s).  
- **Thesis:** SLV offers direct exposure to **silver**, which we expect to be a beneficiary of safe-haven flows as well as long-term industrial trends. In the Iran war context, silver combines a bit of gold’s “fear trade” with the potential to gain from any post-conflict rebuilding or energy shifts. Our thesis is that silver often lags gold at the outset of a crisis but then **kicks into higher gear** as the situation evolves – and we have started to see that. With silver now breaking out to record highs, there is technical and psychological momentum behind it ([moneyweek.com](https://moneyweek.com/investments/silver-and-other-precious-metals/how-to-profit-from-silvers-record-rise#:~:text=2025,market%20is%20facing%20a%20severe)). Investment demand (coins, bars, ETF inflows) has been very robust; the U.S. Mint, for instance, has reported strong sales of Silver Eagles as the public seeks tangible assets. Meanwhile, industrial demand for silver (from solar panel manufacturers, electronics, electric vehicles, 5G, etc.) hit all-time highs in recent years ([www.pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/11/13/solar-underpins-record-high-industrial-demand-for-silver/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20silver%20across%20industrial,Institute%20and%20consultancy%20Metals%20Focus)) and is projected to keep rising long-term, war or not. So SLV is not just a war trade, but a play on fundamental silver supply-demand tightness. Notably, silver’s supply growth is limited (few new major silver mines, and production constrained as it’s often a byproduct). If the war causes disruptions in base metal mining (indirectly curbing silver output) or if high oil prices drive up production costs, silver’s supply could tighten further, amplifying price gains. Central banks don’t buy silver, but private investors might increasingly do so if gold’s price feels out of reach – historically, in precious metal manias, silver often has more explosive upside. Owning SLV allows one to participate in that without worrying about miner specifics. It’s also fairly liquid, though not as large as GLD. Overall, SLV is a bit more *speculative* than GLD, but potentially more rewarding if our outlook of a strong precious metals environment holds.
- **Upside Target:** **$80** (approximately $85–$90/oz silver). This assumes silver continues its uptrend and the gold/silver ratio moves closer to cycle lows. If gold heads to ~$6,000 and the ratio compressed to ~70:1, that implies ~$85 silver, in line with this target. $80 SLV would be a ~23% gain from here. It’s worth noting that silver can overshoot – in past spikes (1980, 2011) it moved very fast at the end. A viral buying frenzy or a short squeeze (retail traders have attempted a “silver squeeze” before) could even push silver to $100+ briefly, which would put SLV near $90–$100, but our formal target is a bit conservative relative to that possibility.  
- **Downside Target:** **$50** (about $52–$55/oz silver). Silver is notoriously volatile, so a pullback could be sharp if conditions change. $50 SLV represents roughly the old resistance level that was finally broken in 2025 ([moneyweek.com](https://moneyweek.com/investments/silver-and-other-precious-metals/how-to-profit-from-silvers-record-rise#:~:text=2025,market%20is%20facing%20a%20severe)) – it should act as strong support now. This scenario might occur if the war risk diminishes and industrial demand simultaneously weakens due to recession. Silver could fall more than gold in that case (because the industrial side would remove some buyers). So a drop to ~$50 (which equates to silver giving back its war premium but still above pre-war levels) is a plausible downside if peace breaks out and economy softens.  
- **Key Risks:** (1) **Economic Recession** – if the war throws the world into a deep recession, industrial demand for silver could falter significantly (e.g. fewer solar installations, electronics sales slump). Silver might underperform or even decline even if gold holds up, at least until stimulus or recovery kicks in. (2) **High Volatility** – Silver prices can swing wildly on speculator sentiment. SLV could see big short-term drops (10%+ moves in days) even if the long-term trend is up. This makes it psychologically tougher to hold. (3) **Fed/Dollar Impact** – Similar to gold, a sharply rising dollar or rising real interest rates would hurt silver. Possibly more so, since silver has less of a central bank support and tends to correlate with risk assets a bit too. If the Fed fights inflation strongly, silver could be hit by both reduced safe-haven need (if inflation expectations are tamed) and industrial demand weakening (via higher interest rates slowing economy). (4) **Already extended** – Silver has already run up 3x from its 2020 lows. Some technical consolidation could happen. If speculative longs are overcrowded, a short-term flush could occur (silver often has vicious corrections even in bull markets).  
- **Risk Level:** **High.** We categorize SLV as higher risk. Silver’s volatility and dual demand drivers make it less predictable. In a war scenario, if things get very bad, gold might be preferred, whereas if things get somewhat bad and then inflationary, silver might shine. It’s riskier than gold, but still a hard asset. Compared to individual silver miners, SLV is lower risk since it doesn’t have company issues, but overall in a portfolio context, expect higher swings than GLD.  
- **Conviction:** **Medium.** We have a positive view on silver but with moderate conviction due to its complexity. We believe holding some silver is wise as part of a war trade basket (for the reasons of potential outperformance), but it’s not as high-conviction as gold which has a more straightforward safe-haven role. Conviction could increase if we see evidence of supply tightening or if the war drags on and prompts massive infrastructure rebuilding (which would be silver-intensive). For now, we like SLV, but size positions accordingly given its volatility.

### WPM – Wheaton Precious Metals (Streaming & Royalty Company)

- **Current Price (Feb 2026):** ~$100 per share. (WPM has rallied strongly, reaching into the low $100s, reflecting its leveraged exposure to gold and silver prices at lower risk).  
- **Thesis:** Wheaton Precious Metals is a **streaming/royalty company** that provides a unique way to gain precious metals exposure. WPM doesn’t mine metal itself; instead, it finances mining projects up-front in exchange for the right to purchase a portion of production at fixed low prices. This model yields **high margins and stable operations** – essentially WPM’s cost per ounce is predetermined (often ~$450/oz for gold streams, ~$5–$6/oz for silver). As gold and silver prices soar, Wheaton enjoys the upside almost dollar-for-dollar, but without having to spend on mining operations or worry about operating cost inflation. In the current environment, WPM is thriving: its streaming contracts (on mines operated by companies like Vale, Newmont, etc.) are delivering ounces that Wheaton can sell at market prices, locking in huge profit spreads. For example, one of Wheaton’s cornerstone agreements is the Salobo copper-gold mine in Brazil (operated by Vale) where WPM gets a stream of gold at a fixed cost – with gold at $5k, that stream is extraordinarily profitable for Wheaton. Importantly, WPM also has significant **silver streams** (it was originally “Silver Wheaton”), including from Peñasquito (Newmont’s mine in Mexico) and Antamina (Peru). So it benefits from both gold *and* silver upside. For an investor, WPM offers a *lower-risk, well-diversified* bet on precious metals. It has around 20+ operating streams across different mines and jurisdictions – so even if one mine has an issue (e.g., a strike or technical problem), it only modestly impacts Wheaton’s overall metal sales. WPM also typically has contracts that extend for the life of mine, ensuring long-term reserves. It has no exposure to oil prices, labor costs, etc.; inflation in mining costs actually **helps** WPM indirectly (if miners face higher costs, they may seek more streaming deals, and existing streams become more valuable). The company is run conservatively (low debt, investment-grade balance sheet) and pays a dividend (often ~1% yield, but growing). In a war scenario, WPM is a *defensive way* to capture the upside in gold/silver while sidestepping many of the operational pitfalls miners might encounter. That’s likely why its stock has been bid up to all-time highs – it’s a market favorite in uncertain times. We expect WPM to continue to outperform most mining equities on a risk-adjusted basis. 
- **Upside Target:** **$115**. We see additional upside as investors could further prize its safe model. $115 would be about a 15% gain. This could happen if gold/silver push higher (WPM’s earnings would climb accordingly) or if there’s rotation from miners to streaming companies for safety. Given WPM’s strong price performance, our upside target is a bit more modest than some miners, reflecting that it’s less undervalued – but don’t underestimate it, in prior cycles royalty stocks sometimes went into euphoric valuation territory. If a true mania for precious assets kicks in, WPM could overshoot toward $120+ (especially if it announces a new major streaming deal or dividend hike).  
- **Downside Target:** **$85**. Wheaton’s downside might be somewhat cushioned by investor loyalty to the model, but if gold/silver retreat significantly, WPM will fall. $85 (around 15% down) would be a level of support (roughly where it traded during a brief dip in late 2025). It’s also near a valuation floor where its P/CF would be very attractive again. Only in a severe gold crash could we see it falling below that (say to $75), but that seems unlikely unless the war premium evaporates completely.  
- **Key Risks:** (1) **Metal price risk** – WPM’s revenues are directly tied to gold/silver price. If those drop, so do its earnings (though its costs remain fixed low, it’s still highly correlated to price). (2) **Counterparty risk** – WPM relies on other companies to actually mine the metals. If any partner’s mine shuts down or underperforms, Wheaton’s streams suffer. We’ve seen this in the past: e.g., Newmont’s Peñasquito mine had a shutdown due to a strike, temporarily cutting off WPM’s silver stream from that asset. If war causes any partner mines to have issues (maybe indirectly via supply chain or local unrest), WPM’s deliveries could be impacted. However, WPM is diversified enough to absorb a mine outage here or there. (3) **Valuation** – Wheaton typically trades at a premium (high P/E) because of its quality. In a market sell-off, high valuation stocks can see bigger declines as momentum reverses. If sentiment shifts away from precious metals, WPM could de-rate. (4) **Tax/Political** – There’s a niche risk that some jurisdictions might challenge streaming agreements or change tax rules (there have been debates in some countries about whether streaming revenue should be taxed differently for the operators). Any adverse legal/ tax change affecting streams could hurt the model, though nothing major has materialized so far.  
- **Risk Level:** **Medium-Low.** For an equity that depends on commodity prices, WPM is on the lower end of risk. It forgoes the extreme upside of a small miner strike discovery, but it also forgoes most downside of cost blowouts. It’s more comparable to a “royalty on gold/silver revenues.” In a war context, its risk is lower than operating miners (since it’s insulated from direct operational disruptions aside from partner issues). There’s still price risk from the commodities, so not as low risk as GLD itself, but relative to mining stocks, it’s relatively safe.  
- **Conviction:** **High.** We have high conviction in WPM as a *differentiated play*. It’s a foundational holding for many institutional investors in the gold space for good reason. In uncertain times, we expect it to be a stalwart. The high conviction is also because it’s a quality company you can hold beyond just the war trade – even after crisis, WPM performs well across cycles due to its solid business model. In summary, WPM is a **top pick for those who want gold/silver exposure with a smoother ride**.

### Additional Considerations – Other Tickers

Aside from the above, a few other tickers merit mention:

- **GDX – VanEck Gold Miners ETF:** This ETF provides broad exposure to gold mining stocks (its top holdings include NEM, AEM, GOLD, etc.). At ~ $80, GDX has roughly tripled from its 2022 lows, reflecting the sector’s surge. GDX is a good *one-stop* choice for those who want to bet on gold miners as a group benefiting from war, without selecting individual names. The ETF spreads risk and includes some mid-tier companies too. It will generally move ~2× the percentage move of gold. We like GDX as a **medium-risk, high-conviction** play on a continuing gold bull market if an Iran war unfolds. Similar ETFs like GDXJ (juniors) exist, but GDXJ carries higher volatility and smaller companies; one could prefer GDX for resilience.

- **KGC – Kinross Gold:** A mid-tier producer (~2 million oz/year) now trading around $10. Kinross offers more speculative upside – it’s historically been discounted due to past mishaps and higher-risk assets. However, it revamped its portfolio (exited Russia, focusing on Americas and West Africa) and is heavily leveraged to gold price. With gold at $5k, Kinross is making windfall profits, yet its stock is still relatively cheap (was under $5 in 2023, now doubled). For investors with appetite for risk, KGC could have further run if the bull market persists. Key risks are its higher cost structure and remaining geopolitical exposure (e.g., mines in Mauritania, which is stable now but in a sensitive region).

- **FNV – Franco-Nevada:** Another royalty streaming company like WPM, trading around $250. Franco is the largest in that space and ultra-steady (diversified streams in gold, silver, also oil). It’s a *very low-risk* precious play (even less operating risk than WPM, since FNV doesn’t even commit to purchase, it just gets royalties). Great for conservative exposure, albeit with somewhat lower yield and higher valuation. If war impact deepens, FNV will hold value well. 

- **PAAS – Pan American Silver:** Trading near $30, PAAS is a leading silver stock that also produces a lot of gold. It recently acquired Yamana’s Latin American assets, boosting its gold output. PAAS is a way to get silver exposure via a company with sizable scale and diversified mines in the Americas. Its stock could benefit from both gold and silver strength. It’s less expensive on valuation than pure silver peers because of its mixed output. A war scenario that supports both metals would directly boost PAAS’s earnings. Risks are usual operational ones in various countries (it has had to navigate local issues, e.g., a currently suspended mine in Guatemala due to community disputes). Still, as a *trade idea*, PAAS could be considered for those bullish on silver’s continuation.

Each of these additional names can be tailored into trades depending on specific focus (gold vs silver, conservative vs aggressive). For instance, an aggressive war play might be long GDXJ (juniors) for maximum leverage, whereas a conservative one might be long FNV or GLD for safety.

## Risk Factors to Monitor

While the outlook for gold and precious metals is bullish under an Iran war scenario, investors must remain vigilant of various risk factors that could derail the thesis:

- **Potential for Gold to Decline Despite War:** It might seem counter-intuitive, but gold can fall even amid conflict under certain conditions. A **swift and decisive resolution** to the conflict is one such scenario. If, for example, a war were to be over quickly or avoided via diplomacy, the rapid unwinding of geopolitical risk premium could send gold tumbling from its highs. Markets tend to price in worst-case scenarios; if reality turns out less dire, there can be a sharp correction (the 2003 Iraq war’s quick conclusion prompted gold to drop after the initial rally ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=But%20the%20onset%20of%20military,disturbingly%20pessimistic%20purchasing%20manager%20surveys))). Another factor is a **deflationary shock or financial crisis** triggered by war – in a liquidity crunch, everything gets sold. We saw in 2008 how even gold was not spared initially: institutions facing margin calls sold gold holdings to raise cash, causing a temporary slump. If an Iran war caused credit markets to freeze or stock markets to crash violently, gold might see a similar short-term sell-off as investors scramble for dollars (the classic “dash for cash”). Additionally, if **hedge funds had leveraged gold longs**, a reversal or spike in volatility could lead to forced liquidations. So, paradoxically, the early phase of a conflict could see gold spike and then suddenly dip if margin calls proliferate. Another risk is if markets anticipate huge **post-war reconstruction leading to growth** (less likely in this case, but if war outcome is seen as boosting long-term stability, capital could rotate out of gold into risk assets).

- **Mining-Specific Risks:** Gold mining stocks carry all the above gold price risks plus their own. In a war, miners could face **operational disruptions** indirectly – for instance, cybersecurity attacks (state or non-state actors could target critical infrastructure, including mining operations or supply chains). Or if the conflict affects global shipping routes or energy availability, mines might struggle to get needed equipment or diesel fuel. **Rising input costs** are a major concern: a Middle East war would likely send oil prices soaring (the World Bank warned of oil in “uncharted waters” if the conflict spreads ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/72152d1d791eed532c2807902297c0fa#:~:text=2023,Bank%20outlines%20three%20potential%20scenarios))). Diesel is a huge cost component for open-pit mines (to run haul trucks, generators, etc.). Explosives and cyanide costs (tied to chemicals and energy) could also jump. So miners might see their AISC creep higher, which slightly offsets the gold price boon. If inflation runs hot globally, labor costs might surge too – **labor strikes** are not uncommon in mining during boom times, as workers demand a larger share of profits. We must watch for wage negotiations or union actions at major mines (for example, South African mining labor issues, or Latin American mine strikes). There’s also **political risk of windfall taxes**: governments seeing miners earn super-profits at $5k gold might increase royalties or impose special taxes. This has precedent (e.g., some countries hiked taxes on mining during past commodity booms). Such moves could dent miners’ equity appeal or future earnings. Lastly, we should consider if war heightens *security risks* at mine sites – while most major gold mines are far from Iran/Israel, companies in West Africa or other regions might face heightened terrorism or instability if global tensions flare (though this is speculative).

- **Currency Effects – USD Safe Haven:** Typically, in global crises the **U.S. dollar** also acts as a safe haven (being the world’s reserve currency). If a Iran-U.S. war breaks out, initially one might see the dollar strengthen as investors seek USD cash and U.S. Treasuries (paradoxically, even if the U.S. is directly involved in the conflict). A strong USD can cap gold’s upside because gold is priced in dollars globally – when the dollar rises, gold becomes more expensive in other currencies, potentially dampening non-USD demand. We have to monitor the dollar index. In the 1991 Gulf War, for instance, once the war outcome became clear, the dollar rallied and gold fell back ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=Following%20the%20current%20war%2C%20there,in%20turn%2C%20could%20encourage%20further)). If the Fed raises interest rates or yields spike due to war spending or inflation, that could further boost USD. On the flip side, if the dollar’s role is questioned (say some countries start selling U.S. assets), gold could decouple and rise with a falling dollar – but currently, strength in USD remains a risk factor that could *limit* gold’s upside. So, a scenario to be wary of is one where **both** gold and USD are seen as safe havens – we’ve had periods where they rise together, but if USD’s rise is very sharp, it could eventually exert gravitational pull on gold downwards (through relative value adjustments). 

- **Are Prices Overextended?** At over $5,200/oz, one must ask: how much war risk is already priced in? Gold has climbed ~50% in the past year ([theweek.com](https://theweek.com/business/markets/what-a-rising-gold-price-says-about-the-global-economy#:~:text=economy%20theweek,rate%20fears%2C%20and%20a%20potential)), much of it anticipating greater geopolitical turmoil. It’s possible that current prices **bake in a significant Iran war premium**. If markets have essentially “bought the rumor,” then when the war “news” actually hits (or even initial battles begin), we could see a classic case of *sell-the-news*. This happened in previous conflicts – gold often peaked right around the start of bombing and then fell as the event was now “known” ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=Gold%20had%20a%20remarkable%20start,in%20New%20York%20and%20Tokyo)) ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=But%20the%20onset%20of%20military,disturbingly%20pessimistic%20purchasing%20manager%20surveys)). We should consider that hedge funds and speculators have built large long positions; if they judge that the upside from here is limited, they might take profits even as war unfolds. Analyst commentary currently suggests that while **upside risks remain, the rally may moderate** ([malaysia.news.yahoo.com](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/gold-prices-us-iran-oil-pound-latest-093312091.html#:~:text=,central%E2%80%91bank%20demand%20are%20underpinning%20prices)). So, one risk is that gold simply consolidates or even drifts lower if no new shocks occur beyond what’s expected. In other words, unless the war escalates beyond the baseline scenario (e.g. drawing in Saudi Arabia, affecting oil shipping in a major way, etc.), gold might have *limited additional upside* and could even correct on any good news. For miners, this is crucial – their stock prices could suffer more on a gold pullback than they gained on the way up. Thus, being cognizant of sentiment (are we at “peak gold fever”?) is important.

- **Equity Market Correlation:** Another risk factor is general market behavior. If a war triggers severe **equity bear markets or credit events**, gold miners – being equities – might correlate with the downturn at times. During panics, correlations go to 1. Even though gold the commodity might be resilient, gold mining stocks could get caught in a broader sell-off (like March 2020 when initially miners fell with the market). If volatility spikes and value-at-risk models force funds to cut positions, miners might be indiscriminately sold. That’s a risk to consider if one is loaded on mining stocks for the war trade – one might experience big drawdowns if equity markets crumble, even if gold eventually benefits.

- **Physical Demand Changes:** A subtle risk – if gold stays extremely high, could we see a drop in physical demand from key markets like India or China due to affordability issues? In 2022-2023, Indian gold demand softened when prices rose too much in rupee terms. If war pushes gold to levels that crush jewelry demand or prompt governments to restrict imports (to protect currency), there could be a headwind on the physical side. However, central banks and investor demand currently far outweigh jewelry, so this is a smaller risk during crisis periods.

In summary, investors should prepare for **volatility**. War-driven rallies can reverse suddenly on any hint of peace or policy intervention. It’s wise to have stop-loss or hedging strategies – for instance, one might hedge mining stock exposure with a short position in a broad equity index during the most intense phase, or use options to protect against downside. Also, closely **monitor war developments**: if it appears conflict might end or not expand, that could be a cue to lock in profits on gold positions. Conversely, if it seems on the verge of escalating (e.g., other nations getting involved), that might mean the gold trade has further legs. Always balance the upside potential with these risk factors for a prudent approach.

## Historical Precedents & Timing Strategy

Historical conflicts offer valuable lessons on **when to enter and exit** precious metals positions around war events:

- **Gold’s Behavior in First 30/60/90 Days of Past Conflicts:** Looking at past Middle East crises, gold often *rallied before or at the outbreak*, then leveled off or fell if the conflict was resolved quickly. In the **1990 Gulf War**, gold started rising as Iraq invaded Kuwait (August 1990) amid uncertainty. By January 1991 when the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Desert Storm, gold had already retreated from earlier highs, anticipating a coalition victory. Within a month of the war’s start, gold was in decline as the conflict ended swiftly in February. At 30, 60, and 90 days into that war, gold was actually lower than pre-invasion levels, finishing 1991 back around $350 ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=After%20the%201991%20war%2C%20gold,And%2C%20although%20it)). The war-induced oil spike had triggered a recession, and once the shooting stopped, attention shifted to the weak economy and a strengthening dollar – a backdrop in which gold underperformed. In the **2003 Iraq War**, the pattern was similar: gold surged in late 2002 and Jan 2003 on war drums (peaking ~$388 in early Feb) ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=Gold%20had%20a%20remarkable%20start,in%20New%20York%20and%20Tokyo)). When the U.S. invasion commenced in late March 2003, gold quickly sold off on the expectation of a quick win ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=But%20the%20onset%20of%20military,disturbingly%20pessimistic%20purchasing%20manager%20surveys)). Within 30 days of the invasion, gold was down around 10-15% from its pre-war peak; at 60 and 90 days, it was even lower (dropping into the $320s by April/May) ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=Index%20are%20significantly%20lower%20than,the%20S%26P%20Gold%20Index%20is)). So anyone who *bought at the war’s start* would have lost in the short run – the optimal move was to sell as the war began if you had ridden the prior run-up. During **smaller flare-ups** like the 2020 U.S.-Iran conflict (Soleimani’s assassination), the timeline was compressed: gold spiked for a few days, then retraced within a week or two ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2020/01/06/markets-iraq-iran-trump-soleimani-oil#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20gold%20hit,three%20months%20against%20the%20yen)) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2020/01/06/markets-iraq-iran-trump-soleimani-oil#:~:text=Yes%2C%20but%3A%20While%20the%20war,Go%20deeper)). The **2023 Israel-Hamas war** saw gold rise for a few weeks, but by 60-90 days in, it stabilized as the conflict stayed regional and didn’t morph into a larger war. These examples teach that **gold’s war premium often peaks around the onset of conflict** and then dissipates if the war doesn’t become a protracted global crisis.

- **Optimal Entry Point – Before, During, or After Initial Shock?** Historically, the best entry was *before* the conflict (when rumors or tensions are building) or sometimes *after* the initial shock and subsequent dip – but not during the *height* of the initial crisis when everyone is panicking into gold. In 1990 and 2003, buying in the calm before the storm yielded gains, but buying on day 1 of bombing would have been buying the top ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=Gold%20had%20a%20remarkable%20start,in%20New%20York%20and%20Tokyo)) ([www.lbma.org.uk](https://www.lbma.org.uk/alchemist/issue-30/not-just-another-war-story#:~:text=But%20the%20onset%20of%20military,disturbingly%20pessimistic%20purchasing%20manager%20surveys)). That suggests that in our current scenario, those who positioned in gold in 2024 or early 2025 as Iran tensions grew have profited immensely. If one is looking to initiate now (with war possibly imminent), one must be cognizant that a lot of the move may have happened. A strategy could be to wait for the initial conflict outbreak and any *overshoot spike*, then after the dust settles (if the war trajectory looks containable), consider taking profits or reducing exposure. Conversely, if one missed the early run, there’s a chance of a **pullback early in the war** which could be a safer entry – especially if one expects extended conflict. Essentially, timing depends on whether you foresee the war escalating or de-escalating from initial expectations. If you believe everyone underestimates the conflict (it will be worse/longer), then even entering during the early war phase could pay off as gold makes new highs over ensuing months. But if you think the war will resolve or be compartmentalized, it’s better to have entered earlier or wait for a significant dip. A practical approach might be scaling in: have some core position from prior to war (to not miss the move), and keep some cash to deploy if gold pulls back during a “peace scare” or a mid-war profit-taking event.

- **Gold Miners vs Gold Bullion in War Periods:** In past conflicts, gold mining stocks have had mixed performance relative to bullion. One crucial factor is the overall equity market. During the early 1991 war period, equities actually rallied strongly after initial uncertainty cleared (the S&P 500 had a relief rally once Operation Desert Storm proved successful). Gold fell and gold miners’ stocks also fell or underperformed as investors rotated back to risk assets. In 2003, equity markets were in a deep bear trough; the Iraq war’s start coincided almost exactly with the bottom of the stock market (March 2003). As war uncertainty lifted, equities surged (the “Iraq War rally”), which ironically made gold miners less appealing at that moment – indeed gold miners had peaked before the war and then lagged as gold fell. Fast forward to recent conflicts: in January 2020, the broader market only wobbled briefly; gold miners did jump when gold spiked, but then leveled off. In late 2023, stock markets were more driven by interest rates than the Israel-Hamas war, so gold miners followed gold modestly upward but were also contending with a rising stock market (which tends to make defensive plays like miners relatively less attractive). The lesson is **context matters**. If a war causes a major equity downturn (risk-off), gold miners might not initially rally as strongly as gold – they could even decline if stock selling is heavy. However, as the situation prolongs, miners should eventually follow gold’s fundamentals. Also, miners’ outperformance vs gold tends to manifest over a slightly longer timeframe as their quarterly earnings reflect the new gold price. For instance, after the 1990-91 Gulf War, by the time gold stabilized and the recession set in, the environment (lower rates, etc.) turned favorable later in the 90s for miners in relative terms. In 2024-2025, we have seen miners eventually outperform gold’s percentage gain ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=acciones%20de%20la%20minera,es%20la%20sudafricana)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/2025-04-20/mineras-de-oro-que-mas-que-duplican-en-bolsa-la-subida-del-metal-precioso.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L86%20Barrick%20Gold,Los%20inversores%20deber%C3%A1n)), but there were periods of disconnect (like in 2024, when AI-driven stock rallies meant gold stocks were ignored despite gold rising ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/gold-stock-valuation-anomaly/#:~:text=decoupled%20from%20gold%20over%20the,remained%20way%20off%20their%20radars))). In the current scenario, if war breaks out and triggers *both* a gold rally and an equity sell-off, miners could initially trade mixed – safe-haven investors will buy them, but generalists might trim due to overall market risk. Over a 30-90 day horizon, if gold stays high, one would expect miners to catch up and likely exceed gold’s move (simply because their earnings momentum will attract buying). 

- **When to rotate or take profit:** Based on history, one strategy could be: **take partial profits on miners when gold hits a frenzy high at war outbreak**, because miners could lag or pull back if the market calms. Then, perhaps **rotate into miners on dips after initial war euphoria**, because as quarters roll on with high gold prices, miners will likely rally strongly (and possibly more sustainably). For gold itself (or GLD), an argument can be made to hold a core position throughout the conflict as insurance, but one might trade around it – e.g., lighten up if a peace deal seems imminent or add if conflict widens. 

As a concrete example: If you held gold through the late 2025 run-up, you might consider trimming a bit as soon as the war *officially* starts (if gold has spiked further). If in 1-2 months the war seems contained, you could trim more or even short-term short gold for a trade. Conversely, if initial skirmishes suggest a worse scenario (like Iran launching missiles at oil infrastructure beyond expectations), you’d hold or add. For miners, because they’ve lagged a bit recently, one might actually hold them a bit into the war start to see if they pop on earnings, but watch the overall market. 

In essence, **before the war = accumulation phase** (which has happened through 2024/25), **during war = high volatility (potentially trim into strength, buy dips)**, and **after initial war phase = reassess**. If it’s a long war, gold could embark on a multi-year bull like the 1970s (where repeated MidEast conflicts + inflation saw gold and miners make secular moves higher). If it’s short, we might go back to pre-war price trends, which in this cycle might still be up due to other factors (like Fed policy or deglobalization). 

Finally, to underscore history: those who bought gold *well before* conflicts (when tensions were just building) generally did the best. Those who chased at peak panic often had to endure pullbacks. Therefore, in our scenario, if gold has already moved a lot on war expectations, caution is warranted about adding big new positions at these elevated levels. Focus on quality (like AEM, WPM, GLD) which can weather a pullback, and be ready to opportunistically add on any correction, since the structural uptrend (central bank buying, etc.) may persist beyond the war itself.
