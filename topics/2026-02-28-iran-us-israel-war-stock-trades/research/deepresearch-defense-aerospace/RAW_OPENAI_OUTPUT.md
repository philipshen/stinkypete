# Historical Performance During Middle East Conflicts

### Gulf War (1990–1991)  
The Persian Gulf War sparked a sharp **short-term rally** in U.S. defense stocks. As Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, major contractors saw their shares surge within days. General Dynamics jumped **~37%** in the first week of fighting ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). Other defense names like Martin Marietta (now part of LMT) climbed around **10%** on the initial success of high-tech weapons (e.g. Patriot missiles hitting Scuds) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=In%20the%20Washington%20area%2C%20a,in%20revenue%20for%20Martin%20Marietta)). This war affirmed the value of precision weapons and drove expectations of more Pentagon orders ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=average%20fell%200)). **Timing:** The rally was **immediate** – defense stocks spiked as televised missile intercepts vindicated their products ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=Wall%20Street%20has%20reflected%20the,percent%20since%20the%20fighting%20began)). However, gains were **short-lived**; after the brief 6-week war ended, the post-Cold War budget drawdown resumed, and defense stocks relinquished some of their initial euphoria.

### Iraq War (2003–2011)  
In the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq invasion, defense stocks had already been rising (boosted by post-9/11 spending). When the war **officially began in March 2003**, the reaction was more muted: many contractors actually **dipped ~4–5%** in the war’s first week ([www.ourmidland.com](https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Changes-in-Defense-Industry-Stock-Prices-7203762.php#:~:text=Contractor%20March%2019%20March%2026,3.1%20percent)) (a “sell-the-news” effect after pre-war run-ups). For example, from March 19 to 26, 2003, Lockheed fell –4.2%, Northrop –4.3%, and General Dynamics –4.0% ([www.ourmidland.com](https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Changes-in-Defense-Industry-Stock-Prices-7203762.php#:~:text=Contractor%20March%2019%20March%2026,3.1%20percent)). As the U.S. quickly toppled Saddam’s regime, defense stocks briefly **rallied** into April 2003 ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/technology/2003/04/07/market-rallies-to-military-success-in-baghdad/00e33362-332b-4010-8317-fac09801aeff/#:~:text=Market%20Rallies%20to%20Military%20Success,10%20%22Warthogs)). But by later 2003, the **peak had passed**. In September 2003, Wall Street downgrades hit the sector, noting that war-driven budget increases were fully priced in and future growth looked slower ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/29/defense-stocks-have-seen-their-peak/541fb3dc-11b6-4957-ae0d-324226a5347e/#:~:text=The%20fighting%20in%20Iraq%20isn%27t,the%20defense%20stock%20boom%20is)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/29/defense-stocks-have-seen-their-peak/541fb3dc-11b6-4957-ae0d-324226a5347e/#:~:text=Pentagon%20spending%20is%20key%20to,in%20their%20volley%20of%20downgrades)). Lockheed and General Dynamics both plunged >10% in a few weeks by Fall 2003 ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/29/defense-stocks-have-seen-their-peak/541fb3dc-11b6-4957-ae0d-324226a5347e/#:~:text=Shares%20of%20Lockheed%20Martin%20Corp,the%20past%20couple%20of%20weeks)). **Takeaway:** Defense stocks rose **ahead** of the Iraq invasion and **peaked early** in the conflict; they then **gave back gains** as the war became protracted and concerns grew that deficits would constrain future defense spending ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/29/defense-stocks-have-seen-their-peak/541fb3dc-11b6-4957-ae0d-324226a5347e/#:~:text=Pentagon%20spending%20is%20key%20to,in%20their%20volley%20of%20downgrades)).

### 2020 US–Iran Flashpoint (Soleimani Strike)  
After the **January 3, 2020** U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, defense stocks spiked on fears of escalation. In one day, Northrop Grumman stock leapt **+5.4%**, Lockheed Martin **+3.6%**, and the defense sector index rose ~1.8% ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-03/defense-stocks-qassem-suleimani#:~:text=%26%20Defense%20Select%20Industry%20index,on%20Friday)) ([www.latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-03/defense-stocks-qassem-suleimani#:~:text=match%20at%20L33%20Shares%20of,5)). Investors anticipated greater U.S. troop presence and munitions usage in the Middle East ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/03/defense-stocks-spike-following-airstrike-against-iranian-commander/#:~:text=Major%20weapons%20builders%20saw%20their,drawing%20immediate%20threats%20of%20retaliation)). However, the tensions **eased within weeks** – Iran’s retaliation was limited, and a broader war didn’t erupt. Consequently, these stocks **quickly leveled off**, and the rally was overshadowed by the looming COVID-19 crisis in February 2020. In hindsight, the Soleimani episode produced a **short-lived spike** rather than a sustained trend.

### 2023–2024 Israel–Hamas War and Regional Strikes  
The war ignited by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel led to a **major rally in U.S. defense shares**. On Monday Oct 9, the first trading day after the attacks, Lockheed Martin stock surged **+8.9%** (its biggest non-earnings jump since March 2020) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%2C%20a%20major,on%20October%209th%5B1)). Northrop Grumman rocketed **+11.4%** the same day ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%2C%20a%20major,on%20October%209th%5B1)), and General Dynamics rose nearly **+10%** ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20witnessed%20an%20impressive,near%20its%20lowest%20level%20since)). RTX (Raytheon) – which had been near 3-year lows – rebounded about **+4–5%** initially ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%20Corporation%2C%20a%20major,on%20October%209th%5B1)) as investors bet on missile defense demand. These stocks **continued climbing** through late 2023: over the ensuing weeks, Lockheed was up **>12%** (Oct 6–Oct 26, 2023) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=and%20aerospace%20stocks%20have%20demonstrated,lowest%20level%20since%20February%202021)). The conflict’s heavy use of interceptors (Iron Dome, David’s Sling) and munitions spurred expectations of replenishment orders. Even by mid-2024, as Israel’s campaign and sporadic Houthi rebel attacks in the Red Sea persisted, defense stocks mostly **held their gains**. One year on, by Oct 2024, U.S. defense giants had massively outperformed the market – e.g. **Raytheon RTX returned +82.7%** in the year following the war’s outbreak, vs ~36% for the S&P 500 ([responsiblestatecraft.org](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/october-7-hamas-attack/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20these%20weapons%20and,produced%20a%20%248%2C269%20total%20return)). Lockheed delivered a **+54.9%** total return in that year ([responsiblestatecraft.org](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/october-7-hamas-attack/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%2C%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest,S%26P%20500%20by%20about%2018)). This sustained rally reflected both immediate war-driven orders and a broader increase in global defense budgets. **Timing:** Investors piled in **within days** of the conflict, and stocks peaked about **12 months later** at record highs ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/10/defense-stocks-may-keep-rallying-after-gains-from-israel-hamas-war.html#:~:text=2023%202%3A56%20PM%20EDT%20Sarah,Min%40_sarahmin%20WATCH%20LIVE)) ([responsiblestatecraft.org](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/october-7-hamas-attack/#:~:text=Lockheed%20Martin%2C%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20largest,S%26P%20500%20by%20about%2018)). Notably, as of early 2025, valuations appeared elevated, implying some war premium that could retrace once tensions abate.

**Summary:** Defense stocks tend to **spike quickly** at a conflict’s onset (sometimes even in anticipation), then either plateau or retrench depending on the war’s duration and budget response. Short, decisive wars (1991, 2020 flare-up) saw only brief outperformance. Protracted or expanding conflicts (Iraq 2003+, Israel–Hamas 2023+) led to more **sustained rallies**, especially when accompanied by higher military spending. Peaks often occur **well before** the conflict ends, as expectations get priced in early. After the initial euphoria, the **follow-through depends on policy** – without further budget boosts, stocks can surrender gains (e.g. 2003–04). This historical context frames current valuations and informs how an Iran–US/Israel war might play out in the defense sector.

# Current Valuations and Financial Health (Early 2026)

As of early 2026, defense equities trade near peak levels after the 2023–25 run-up. **Valuations are stretched versus history**, reflecting strong recent performance and war-driven optimism:

- **Lockheed Martin (LMT)** – Shares trade around the mid-$600s, up ~50%+ from pre-2023 levels. LMT’s **P/E ratio is ~21–22×** (TTM) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LMT/LOCKHEED%20MARTIN/pe-ratio#:~:text=dividing%20it%20by%20the%20most,75)), above its 5-year average in the mid-teens. This multiple expanded as the stock hit all-time highs. On an EV/EBITDA basis LMT is in the mid-teens (historically ~10–12×). *Financials:* 2025 revenue was ~$73B with only modest growth, but EPS grew ~10% to about $28 (adjusted). Free cash flow is robust – ~$7–8B in 2025 – equating to a **~4% FCF yield** ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Incremental%20ROIC%20%20%7C%206.1,RTX)). The company carries **net debt ~3× EBITDA** ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Operating%20Margin%20%20%7C%208.3,RTX)), slightly high but manageable. Crucially, Lockheed sits on a **record $194 billion backlog** (2.5× annual sales) ([fintool.com](https://fintool.com/news/lockheed-martin-q4-record-backlog-missile-ramp#:~:text=9%25%20year,3%20deal%20announced%20earlier)) after booking multi-year contracts (e.g. F-35 orders). Its **dividend yield is ~2.7%** (now ~2% after stock appreciation) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=match%20at%20L330%20Company%20,low%20payout%20%2B%20high%20FCF)) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Dividend%20Yield%20%20%7C%201.84,%7C%20LMT)), with a conservative ~47% payout ratio, and it executes periodic buybacks. Lockheed’s valuation is elevated – e.g. **~30×** trailing GAAP earnings at 2025’s end ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LMT/LOCKHEED%20MARTIN/pe-ratio#:~:text=,25.69)) – but relative to defense peers its premium is for best-in-class scale and cash generation.

- **RTX Corporation (RTX)** – RTX (the merged Raytheon/United Tech) trades near ~$200 per share – a dramatic recovery from ~$75 lows in mid-2023. This surge, coupled with depressed earnings in 2024–25 from one-time charges, makes RTX’s **P/E appear ~40×** on a trailing basis ([ycharts.com](https://ycharts.com/companies/RTX/pe_ratio#:~:text=RTX%20PE%20Ratio%20Analysis%20,00)). (On **forward** earnings the multiple is lower, as engine repair costs subside – 2026e P/E closer to mid-20s.) RTX’s **enterprise value is ~$190B**, and with 2025 sales ~$89B ([www.rtx.com](https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2026/01/27/rtx-reports-2025-results-and-announces-2026-outlook#:~:text=Full%20year%202025)), its EV/EBITDA is in the high teens. Revenue grew ~10% in 2025 as commercial aerospace rebounded and defense orders picked up. **Backlog:** RTX boasts the largest backlog in the industry at **$268 billion** (end of 2025) ([www.rtx.com](https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2026/01/27/rtx-reports-2025-results-and-announces-2026-outlook#:~:text=,Collins%27%20Simmonds%20Precision%20Products%20business)) – including $107B defense and $161B commercial (Pratt & Collins) – up sharply from $217B mid-2025 ([www.rtx.com](https://www.rtx.com/zh-cn/news/news-center/2025/04/22/rtx-reports-q1-2025-results#:~:text=,and%20%2492%20billion%20of%20defense)). However, margins have been under pressure (2025 adjusted EPS $6.29 ([www.rtx.com](https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2026/01/27/rtx-reports-2025-results-and-announces-2026-outlook#:~:text=,4%20billion%20versus%20prior%20year))). Free cash flow was $7.9B in 2025 ([www.rtx.com](https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2026/01/27/rtx-reports-2025-results-and-announces-2026-outlook#:~:text=,4%20billion%20versus%20prior%20year)) (~2–3% FCF yield). RTX pays a **~1.9% dividend yield** ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Company%20%20,%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Watch%20%E2%80%94%20historically%20high)), but its payout has been high relative to earnings (five-year avg ~100% of net income) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=LMT%20%20%7C%202.75,%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Watch%20%E2%80%94%20historically%20high)) due to merger accounting impacts. The balance sheet is decent with **net debt ~2.5× EBITDA** ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Operating%20Margin%20%20%7C%208.3,RTX)) and management focused on **deleveraging and buybacks** once the Pratt engine recalls are resolved. **Valuation vs history:** RTX’s current multiples are well above its norm – the stock’s war-fueled 80% rally ([responsiblestatecraft.org](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/october-7-hamas-attack/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20these%20weapons%20and,produced%20a%20%248%2C269%20total%20return)) means a lot of good news is priced in, so any misstep or peace dividend could compress the P/E significantly.

- **Northrop Grumman (NOC)** – Northrop trades around the mid-$500s. Its **P/E is ~25×** trailing ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NOC/northrop-grumman/pe-ratio#:~:text=dividing%20it%20by%20the%20most,03)), somewhat inflated by a one-off charge in 2023 (normalized ~18–20×). The stock hasn’t run as far as some peers – NOC is up roughly 25–30% from 2023 troughs, partly lagging due to program delays. **Financials:** 2025 sales were ~$42B ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/northrop-grumman-hits-record-backlog-2026-growth-remains-cautious-2601/#:~:text=,and%20adjusted%20EPS%20rising%2013)) (+3% YoY) with better margins in H2, yielding ~$21 adjusted EPS. Free cash flow hit $3.3B in 2025 ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/northrop-grumman-hits-record-backlog-2026-growth-remains-cautious-2601/#:~:text=,and%20adjusted%20EPS%20rising%2013)) and FCF yield is ~2.1% ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Incremental%20ROIC%20%20%7C%206.1,RTX)). **Backlog:** NOC reported a **record $95 billion backlog** exiting 2025 ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/northrop-grumman-hits-record-backlog-2026-growth-remains-cautious-2601/#:~:text=,and%20adjusted%20EPS%20rising%2013)) (strong international orders and the new B-21 bomber program). That equals ~2.3× annual revenue – robust but below LMT/RTX levels. Northrop’s dividend yield is about **1.6%** ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=LMT%20%20%7C%202.75,%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Watch%20%E2%80%94%20historically%20high)), with a low ~40% payout ratio, and it has been an active repurchaser of shares in past years (shrinking its float ~20% over the last decade). Its balance sheet is **reasonable (2.2× net debt/EBITDA) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Operating%20Margin%20%20%7C%208.3,RTX))**. In valuation terms, Northrop is around market-multiple for 2026 (~20× forward earnings), which is *slightly above* its long-term median. This reflects anticipation of growth from the B-21 stealth bomber, GBSD missile program, and space systems, balanced by recent execution concerns. 

- **General Dynamics (GD)** – GD’s stock in early 2026 trades around $330–340, up from ~$220 in 2023. It carries a **~22.5× P/E** ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GD/General%20Dynamics/pe-ratio#:~:text=dividing%20it%20by%20the%20most,50)) (trailing GAAP EPS; normalized P/E closer to ~18× after adjusting a 2025 charge). Unlike pure-play defense peers, GD has a large civilian business (Gulfstream jets) which lifted results in 2025. The company delivered **10% revenue growth to $52.5B** in 2025 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/general-dynamics-fy-2025-presentation-doubledigit-growth-amid-record-backlog-93CH-4083039#:~:text=The%20defense%20and%20aerospace%20giant,improvement%20over%202024%20results)) – unusually high for GD – and a 11% EPS jump to ~$15.45 ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/general-dynamics-fy-2025-presentation-doubledigit-growth-amid-record-backlog-93CH-4083039#:~:text=The%20defense%20and%20aerospace%20giant,improvement%20over%202024%20results)). Critically, GD reported its **“highest backlog in history” at $118 billion** ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/general-dynamics-fy-2025-presentation-doubledigit-growth-amid-record-backlog-93CH-4083039#:~:text=Perhaps%20most%20notably%2C%20the%20company%E2%80%99s,signaling%20strong%20future%20revenue%20potential)) (up 30% YoY), fueled by large orders for business jets and Navy submarines. Its **book-to-bill exceeded 1.3** in 2025, signaling growth. GD generates strong cash flow (2025 FCF ~$4.8B, ~5.4% yield – highest of the group ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Incremental%20ROIC%20%20%7C%206.1,RTX))) and has the **healthiest balance sheet (~1.2× net debt/EBITDA) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Operating%20Margin%20%20%7C%208.3,RTX))**. It’s regarded as a **“stable dividend machine”** ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=match%20at%20L431%206,Dynamics%3A%20The%20Stable%20Dividend%20Machine)) – current yield ~1.8% ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Company%20%20,%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Watch%20%E2%80%94%20historically%20high)) with a low ~35% payout, and 26 consecutive years of dividend increases. GD’s valuation is slightly above its historical average (mid-teens P/E) given the run-up. Investors may be assigning a premium for its diversification and the visibility of long-cycle programs (like ~$10B Columbia-class submarine contracts). 

- **L3Harris Technologies (LHX)** – LHX (a mid-tier defense player) saw its stock surge to ~$280–290 by early 2026, recovering from ~$180 in 2023. The run-up and some heavy amortization depressed its reported earnings, leaving a **lofty ~32× P/E** (TTM) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LHX/l3harris-technologies/pe-ratio#:~:text=L3Harris%20Technologies%20Inc%20PE%20Ratio,2025%20%7C%20LHX)). On an adjusted basis (2025 non-GAAP EPS ~$10.73 ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=,GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20of%20%2410.73))), the P/E is ~26×. L3Harris’s revenue for 2025 was $21.9B ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=,GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20of%20%2410.73)) (+3% reported, 5% organic), and importantly **orders hit $27.5B (book-to-bill 1.3) ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=Full%20Year))** – indicating accelerating demand. Its backlog isn’t disclosed in dollar terms in the earnings release, but CEO commentary notes a *“record backlog”* heading into 2026 ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=Kubasik%20added%2C%20,business%20via%20capex%20and%20R%26D)) (likely on the order of ~$30B+, roughly 1.3–1.4× sales). LHX has been integrating Aerojet Rocketdyne (acquired 2023) and divesting some businesses, which impacted margins (2025 operating margin ~9.7% GAAP ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=,GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20of%20%2410.73))). Free cash flow was $2.8B ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=,GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20of%20%2410.73)) (~2.3% yield) and expected to improve as synergies kick in. Debt is moderate at ~2.5× EBITDA ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Operating%20Margin%20%20%7C%208.3,RTX)) post-Aerojet deal. **Shareholder returns:** LHX yields about **1.4–1.5%** dividend ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LHX/l3harris-technologies/dividend-yield-history#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%7C)) and paused buybacks during the merger, but is likely to resume repurchases in 2026. *Valuation context:* LHX historically traded ~15–20× earnings before its recent M&A; now the stock reflects a premium for its **“high-growth” niche** in command, control, comms, and space payloads. The valuation assumes successful integration of Aerojet (making LHX a key missile propulsion provider) and margin expansion above 15% (adj. segment margin was 15.8% in 2025 ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=,GAAP%20diluted%20EPS%20of%20%2410.73))). Any integration hiccups or budget normalization could cause multiple contraction from these elevated levels.

**In summary,** defense primes now command **above-average valuations**. Across the group, **P/E ratios are in the 22–32 range** (vs low-teens in prior years), and EV/EBITDA in the mid-to-high teens. **Backlogs are at record highs** for all five companies – providing multi-year revenue visibility. Balance sheets are generally strong, with GD and NOC the least leveraged ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Operating%20Margin%20%20%7C%208.3,RTX)). All five pay dividends (yields ~1.5–2.5%) and plan share buybacks, though **RTX and LHX have higher payout ratios** (due to recent earnings hits) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=LMT%20%20%7C%202.75,%E2%9A%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Watch%20%E2%80%94%20historically%20high)). Current valuations imply that a fair bit of **conflict optimism is priced in** – investors are paying up for future growth expected from heightened global tensions. Notably, the defense sector’s relative P/E to the S&P 500 is near a decade high, suggesting **less margin for error**. These rich valuations set the stage for the **upside vs. downside** in an Iran war scenario.

# Order Backlogs and Contract Pipeline

Each company’s **order backlog** is at or near all-time highs, reflecting years of robust orders and recent war-driven demand. These backlogs represent contracts in hand (funded and unfunded) that will convert to revenue over coming years – a key indicator of future growth. Below we detail backlog size and **key programs** (especially those relevant to a Middle East theater) for the five firms:

- **Lockheed Martin:** Backlog reached a **record $194 billion** at end-2025 ([fintool.com](https://fintool.com/news/lockheed-martin-q4-record-backlog-missile-ramp#:~:text=9%25%20year,3%20deal%20announced%20earlier)) – roughly 2.5× Lockheed’s annual sales. This includes huge multi-year awards for the **F-35 Lightning II** fighter (Lockheed’s marquee program, with over 3,000 jets planned worldwide) and missile systems. Relevant to an Iran conflict, Lockheed’s portfolio includes the **THAAD** theater defense system and **PAC-3** Patriot *“hit-to-kill”* interceptors – both vital for shooting down ballistic missiles. The company recently inked a framework to **quadruple THAAD interceptor production** to 400 per year ([fintool.com](https://fintool.com/news/lockheed-martin-q4-record-backlog-missile-ramp#:~:text=9%25%20year,3%20deal%20announced%20earlier)), anticipating higher demand. Lockheed also produces the **MLRS/HIMARS** rocket launcher and **ATACMS** long-range missiles, which could see use in a regional war for striking targets. Other key programs: **Aegis Combat System** (for U.S. Navy missile defense), **F-16 fighter jets** (still being built for export), and advanced munitions like the **JASSM/LRASM** cruise missiles. Lockheed’s pipeline is bolstered by Foreign Military Sales – e.g. F-35 orders from allies (recently Finland, Switzerland) and potential new F-35 customers in the Gulf if U.S. policy shifts. It’s also working on next-gen hypersonic weapons and the Next-Gen Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter (pending award). With global tensions high, Lockheed’s broad backlog spanning aircraft, missiles, and space systems positions it to capture many **supplemental orders** that an Iran war could trigger.

- **RTX (Raytheon Technologies):** Total backlog stands at **$268 billion** ([www.rtx.com](https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2026/01/27/rtx-reports-2025-results-and-announces-2026-outlook#:~:text=,Collins%27%20Simmonds%20Precision%20Products%20business)) (split ~$107B defense, $161B commercial). On the defense side, **Raytheon Missiles & Defense** and **RIS** (Intelligence & Space) have hefty order books for systems likely to see increased demand in the Middle East. Key programs: **Patriot SAM systems** – Raytheon builds the Patriot air-defense batteries and GEM-T interceptors deployed by the U.S., Israel, Saudi, etc. Patriot units would be rushed to defend Gulf allies and U.S. bases from Iranian missiles. Raytheon also co-produces Israel’s **Iron Dome** (it supplies the American-made Tamir interceptors, branded SkyHunter ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Major%20arms%20companies%2C%20including%20Lockheed,Dome%20System%20and%20SkyHunter%20Missile))) – replenishment orders for interceptors are already in pipeline after intensive use in Gaza. Offensive weapons: RTX makes the **Tomahawk cruise missile**, often the first-strike weapon in U.S. conflicts. A war with Iran could see dozens (if not hundreds) of Tomahawks launched from U.S. ships/subs, necessitating significant restocking – benefitting Raytheon. Other munitions: **AMRAAM and Sidewinder** air-to-air missiles (used by U.S./allied fighters), **JDAM kits** (to convert bombs to smart weapons – though Boeing is prime, RTX supplies guidance parts), **Paveway laser-guided bombs**, and the new **StormBreaker** glide bomb. Raytheon’s radar and sensor business is also key: it provides **early warning radars**, **SPY-6 radars** for Aegis, and surveillance systems that would be in high demand. The pipeline includes large contracts like a $1.2B award (July 2025) for Patriot systems to Switzerland and pending Patriot sales to Sweden and others. Middle-East specific, the U.S. has been working with Saudi Arabia and UAE on potential **missile defense upgrades** – e.g. Saudi Arabia could pursue **THAAD** (Lockheed/RTX) or more Patriots. Raytheon’s Pratt & Whitney unit, while commercial-heavy, also supplies **military jet engines** (for F-35, F-15, etc.), adding to potential orders if allies accelerate fighter purchases. Overall, RTX’s backlog is well-stocked with the **exact systems likely to be expended** in a conflict, positioning the company for follow-on orders.

- **Northrop Grumman:** Backlog at record **$95 billion** ([www.ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/northrop-grumman-hits-record-backlog-2026-growth-remains-cautious-2601/#:~:text=,and%20adjusted%20EPS%20rising%2013)), of which a large chunk is classified or long-cycle programs. Northrop is lead contractor on the **B-21 Raider** stealth bomber (for the U.S. Air Force’s future long-range strike needs) – while not directly a Middle East conflict tool in 2026 (B-21 is still in testing), this $80B+ program underpins Northrop’s growth. In regional context, Northrop’s contributions include **surveillance and strike drones**: it built the RQ-4 **Global Hawk** UAV (used extensively for high-altitude ISR over conflict zones) and MQ-4C Triton. Any Iran conflict would rely on persistent ISR – potentially driving demand for systems like Global Hawk or its next-gen replacements. Northrop also makes the **RQ-180** stealth drone (secretive, for contested airspace) which could be relevant for spying on Iran. Another key area is **missile defense and space:** Northrop is a partner on **GMD** (national missile defense) and builds the **SBIRS** missile-warning satellites’ payload (now moving to Next-Gen OPIR satellites). If Iran’s missile activity increases, more investments in space-based infrared sensors and battlefield management systems (where Northrop has programs) could follow. Northrop’s **naval systems** unit produces **Aegis destroyer radars and COMBATSS-21** for littoral ships, plus minelaying and mine-hunting systems that might see use keeping Hormuz Strait open. Notably, Northrop’s pipeline includes the new **ICBM (Sentinel) program** – not directly tied to an Iran war, but indicative of broader budget priority on strategic deterrence. The backlog also reflects international sales like Japan’s E-2D Hawkeye early-warning planes and allied-space contracts. Overall Northrop’s book is heavily skewed to U.S. modernization, but any *surge* contracts for an Iran war (drones, ISR, perhaps additional **SEAD** weapons like the AGM-88 HARM which Northrop contributes to) would add to its orders. 

- **General Dynamics:** GD ended 2025 with **$118 billion total backlog**, its highest ever ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/general-dynamics-fy-2025-presentation-doubledigit-growth-amid-record-backlog-93CH-4083039#:~:text=Perhaps%20most%20notably%2C%20the%20company%E2%80%99s,signaling%20strong%20future%20revenue%20potential)). About $75B of this is from its Defense segments and ~$43B from Gulfstream jets (which saw booming orders). GD’s combat systems backlog includes ~**$12B for M1 Abrams tanks** (some for U.S. upgrades, but also Poland, Taiwan orders) and billions for **Stryker and LAV armored vehicles** – relevant if U.S. or allies needed to bolster ground forces in the Gulf (e.g. Saudi Arabia or Kuwait could accelerate tank buys if Iran threatened a ground war by proxy). The Marine Systems segment has a **$42B+ backlog** building new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines and Virginia-class attack subs – long-term programs not immediately impacted by Iran, but a major portion of GD’s pipeline. In aviation, Gulfstream’s order book (~backlog of 200+ jets) doesn’t directly tie to war, but geopolitical tensions have enriched many clients (e.g. Middle East VIPs) who buy business jets, indirectly benefiting GD. One defense area where GD has direct Middle East exposure is **munitions and missiles** via its Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit: GD makes large-caliber ammunition, artillery shells, and propellants. The U.S. has been drawing down artillery stocks for Ukraine; a potential Iran contingency might spur orders for **155mm artillery rounds**, rockets, and bomb bodies – some of which GD supplies. Also, GD manufactures **Arleigh Burke-class destroyers** and other warships (at its Bath Iron Works yard) – any expansion of the U.S. 5th Fleet presence for Iran could translate into support contracts or long-term orders (though new ship orders would be more influenced by China/navy strategy than a short-term Iran fight). In summary, GD’s backlog is filled with big-ticket platforms (subs, ships, jets) ensuring stable revenue. War-related upside for GD might come from increased **operational tempo logistics** (services contracts) and **consumables orders** (ammo), rather than new platform sales – though allies in the region could be motivated to purchase GD’s land systems (tanks/vehicles) if threat perceptions grow.

- **L3Harris Technologies:** LHX’s reported backlog figure isn’t explicitly broken out, but the strong orders in 2024–25 imply backlog well above $25B (likely a company record). L3Harris’s pipeline is unique: it’s focused on high-tech subsystems and niche platforms. Key programs in backlog include classified **ISR payloads** for space and airborne systems, **communications networks** for the U.S. military (radios, tactical datalinks), and now with Aerojet Rocketdyne, a backlog of **rocket motor deliveries** for various missiles. In an Iran war scenario, L3Harris could see *indirect* backlog boosts as a supplier: e.g. increased production of Patriot, THAAD, JAVELIN, or HIMARS rockets means more Aerojet rocket motors sold. (Notably, **Aerojet’s order book** was strong due to demand for Javelin and HIMARS motors after Ukraine – a trend that would extend with Iran-related demand). LHX also makes **electronic warfare systems** and avionics – for example, it supplies the **Viper Shield EW suite for F-16s** and other countermeasure systems that allies may seek urgently. Another area is **space and intel:** L3Harris has contracts for imaging and surveillance satellites and analytic software; heightened focus on monitoring Iran (its nuclear sites, missile launches, etc.) could lead to additional contracts in this realm. They also recently won a role in the **US Army’s TITAN ground station** program (to process sensor data on the battlefield). In terms of FMS, L3Harris is involved in international sales of radios and night vision devices – Middle Eastern militaries might accelerate those buys. Lastly, LHX’s pending opportunities include the **U.S. Army’s XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle** team (they provide sensors) and potentially the **UK’s MOSAIC communication program**, which aren’t Iran-specific but contribute to growth. In short, L3Harris’s backlog and pipeline are tied to the *“connective tissue”* of warfare – communications, sensors, and components – many of which would see **surge orders** if U.S. forces were operating intensely against Iran. Its acquisition of Aerojet also puts key **missile contracts** (e.g. for Stinger, AMRAAM motors) into LHX’s backlog, making it a stealth beneficiary of any missile usage spike.

**Overall Backlog Trend:** All five companies have **book-to-bill ratios ≥1** lately, so backlogs are **expanding** ([www.l3harris.com](https://www.l3harris.com/newsroom/press-release/2026/01/l3harris-technologies-reports-strong-full-year-and-fourth-quarter#:~:text=Full%20Year)). This is fueled by global militarization – conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have prompted nations to place huge orders (e.g. European rearmament, Gulf states’ shopping lists). For Middle East conflict specifics, **missile defense systems** (Patriot, THAAD, Iron Dome) are prominent in backlogs (Lockheed, RTX). **Combat aircraft** like F-35s (Lockheed) and F-15s (Boeing/RTX engines) are in high demand – e.g. Israel is likely to request additional F-35s and munitions, and Gulf states might revive fighter procurements if threats rise. **Precision munitions** are a critical pipeline item – U.S. inventories of guided missiles and bombs are being replenished through multi-billion $$ contracts to these firms. In late 2023, Congress approved a **$14 billion aid package for Israel** (largely for air defense interceptors, artillery, and Iron Dome rockets) ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Major%20arms%20companies%2C%20including%20Lockheed,Dome%20System%20and%20SkyHunter%20Missile)), effectively converting into new orders for contractors like RTX and GD (for ammunition). This highlights how quickly backlogs can swell from wartime appropriations. 

Going forward, an Iran conflict could further **add to backlogs** via emergency orders: e.g. the U.S. might place multi-year production contracts for missiles (similar to how it did for Stingers/Javelins after 2022). The current backlogs provide a **buffer of revenue** even if some political headwinds emerge – but importantly, they also signal potential **capacity constraints** (companies will be ramping flat-out to deliver existing orders, which affects how much *new* business they can take on in the short term).

# Iran War – Specific Upside Catalysts for Defense Contractors

A direct war involving Iran, the U.S., and Israel would unleash **significant tailwinds** for defense and aerospace firms. The conflict’s dynamics – likely intensive missile warfare, air strikes, and naval engagements – align with many products in these companies’ portfolios. Key upside catalysts include:

- **Surging Munitions Consumption:** A U.S./Israel vs Iran war would rapidly draw down stocks of precision weapons, **forcing urgent restocking**. Expect heavy use of **cruise missiles** (Raytheon’s Tomahawk) in initial strikes on Iranian air defenses and infrastructure. U.S. Navy vessels and subs in the Gulf could fire hundreds of Tomahawks, each ~$1.5M, implying big follow-on orders for RTX. The conflict would also see extensive release of **air-to-ground PGMs** – e.g. JDAM smart bombs, Paveway laser-guided bombs, Small Diameter Bombs – which would need replenishment (benefiting RTX, Boeing, and Lockheed’s suppliers). Israel, for its part, would expend large quantities of **Iron Dome interceptors** (co-produced by RTX) and offensive munitions like **SPICE bombs** (partly supplied by U.S. firms). The U.S. has already signaled willingness to resupply allies quickly – for example, it moved to help the UAE replenish interceptors after Houthi missile attacks ([latterdaysaintmag.com](https://latterdaysaintmag.com/news/exclusive-u-s-to-help-uae-replenish-missile-defense-interceptors-after-houthi-attacks/#:~:text=Exclusive,down%20incoming%20missiles%20following%20a)). In a wider Iran war, the **Pentagon would likely tap contractors for fast-tracked munitions contracts** worth billions. This is a direct revenue catalyst – during the 2003 Iraq invasion, the U.S. spent over 5,000 Tomahawks and JDAMs in weeks; an Iran campaign could equal or exceed that, translating to immediate orders for replacements.

- **Missile Defense & Anti-Drone Systems:** Iran and its proxies have large missile and drone arsenals, so defending bases and cities becomes paramount. This would accelerate orders of **missile defense batteries**. Likely winners: **Patriot PAC-3** and **THAAD**. The U.S. might deploy additional Patriot battalions to the Gulf and Israel (Raytheon’s radars, Lockheed’s PAC-3 missiles), and rush-deliver **THAAD units** to regional allies (Lockheed). Congressional support for more interceptors is a given if U.S. forces or allies come under heavy missile fire. We saw this catalyst in Ukraine and Israel conflicts, and it would be magnified with Iran’s longer-range missiles. Also, **naval missile defense** would get a boost – Aegis BMD ships armed with SM-3 and SM-6 interceptors (made by RTX) would guard carriers in the Gulf, likely leading to expanded buy of SM-6 missiles. The Pentagon is *already pressing* industry to dramatically ramp up output of such missiles ([www.roic.ai](https://www.roic.ai/news/pentagon-pushes-defense-contractors-to-dramatically-ramp-up-missile-production-09-29-2025#:~:text=,intensity%20conflict)). An Iran war would validate those warnings – expect production of Patriots, SM-6, THAAD, Iron Dome, etc. to potentially **double or quadruple** with urgent funding ([www.roic.ai](https://www.roic.ai/news/pentagon-pushes-defense-contractors-to-dramatically-ramp-up-missile-production-09-29-2025#:~:text=,intensity%20conflict)). Additionally, **counter-drone systems** would be in high demand given Iran’s use of UAV swarms. This could mean rapid procurement of systems like RTX’s **Coyote drone-killer** or Israeli **Iron Beam laser** (which uses U.S. components). L3Harris and others that make electronic warfare jammers for drones might also see a surge in orders. In short, anything related to **shooting down incoming threats** – from ballistic missiles to kamikaze drones – would see **accelerated contracts**.

- **Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR):** High-quality ISR is the backbone of modern warfare, and against Iran’s dispersed targets, the U.S. would invest heavily here. That implies more **drone deployments** (Northrop’s Global Hawk, or possibly boosting orders of General Atomics MQ-9s – not publicly traded, but components by LHX/RTX). Northrop could benefit if the Air Force requests additional **E-8 JSTARS** or similar battle-management assets to track Iranian forces. Space-based ISR is another area – L3Harris and Northrop, which provide spy satellite payloads and ground processing, could get supplemental funding to enhance real-time overhead coverage of Iran (e.g. launch more imaging or SIGINT satellites). **Reconnaissance aircraft** like Boeing’s P-8 (with Raytheon sensors) and Northrop’s RQ-4 would fly around the clock, meaning more spare parts and possibly extending production lines. Any *surprises* in the conflict (like hidden nuclear sites or mobile launchers) could prompt Congress to fund **new ISR programs** – for instance, fast-tracking a drone that can loiter over Iran longer or investing in AI surveillance (contracts likely flowing to RTX, LHX for analytics). Essentially, war would loosen purses for all things **“find and track the enemy”** – a boon for contractors in communications, sensor, and space segments.

- **Rapid Supplemental Funding:** A shooting war with Iran would almost certainly lead the U.S. Congress to pass **emergency defense appropriations**. This happened in every major conflict (e.g. ~$40B supplemental early in Iraq War). Given Iran’s capabilities, one could expect a supplemental on the order of **tens of billions of dollars**. That money would specifically target replenishments and readiness: missiles, bombs, troop protection gear, spare parts, overtime for production lines, etc. The contractors would directly benefit as these supplementals translate to new orders **on top of** baseline Pentagon budgets. Notably, in late 2023 the U.S. already approved a $14B Israel aid focused on air defenses ([aoav.org.uk](https://aoav.org.uk/2023/stock-prices-of-major-defence-companies-surge-in-wake-of-october-7th-attacks-in-israel/#:~:text=Major%20arms%20companies%2C%20including%20Lockheed,Dome%20System%20and%20SkyHunter%20Missile)); an Iran war would involve U.S. forces directly and thus command a much larger package (potentially $50–100B across services). These funds could expedite planned programs – e.g. paying to add a second production line for PAC-3 missiles at Lockheed, or to surge F-35 deliveries by funding extra supplier tooling. Essentially, conflict-triggered funding can **pull forward** future revenue that was spread over many years into a much shorter timeframe for industry. It can also lead to **multiyear contract awards** under urgent authorities. For instance, the Pentagon could place a multiyear bulk order for 1,000 Tomahawks and SM-6s at once (something it’s considering ([www.roic.ai](https://www.roic.ai/news/pentagon-pushes-defense-contractors-to-dramatically-ramp-up-missile-production-09-29-2025#:~:text=,intensity%20conflict))), locking in years of work for RTX at favorable economics. The market generally rewards these moves with higher stock prices as they improve visibility and scale.

- **Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Boost, especially in the Middle East:** An Iran war would deeply alarm Gulf Arab states (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar) and potentially Turkey and others. These countries would likely go on a **buying spree for American weaponry**, both to bolster defenses and to align with the U.S. Israeli defense might get additional U.S.-funded support too. Possible FMS accelerations: Saudi Arabia and the UAE have long sought more advanced **missile defenses** – Saudi’s THAAD deal (valued ~$15B) could be expedited, directly benefiting Lockheed. The UAE might order additional THAAD batteries or Patriots beyond its current inventory. **F-35 fighters** might finally be cleared for sale to the UAE or even Saudi in a post-war diplomatic realignment – huge potential win for Lockheed (each F-35 is ~$80M). Even if F-35 is politically sensitive, one could see increased orders of **F-15EX or F-16 Block 70** for Gulf states (Boeing/Lockheed). Israel, for its part, would certainly ask for more **Arrow-3 interceptors** (co-developed by Boeing) and possibly U.S. bunker-buster bombs (Lockheed and Boeing make components). Smaller Gulf states like Qatar and Bahrain might invest in coastal defense (Raytheon’s Harpoon/NSM missiles) if Iran’s navy threatens shipping. Essentially, the **threat of Iran** could unify the region in an arms-buying binge from U.S. suppliers – a modern analogue to how Gulf states armed up during the Gulf War and after. These FMS deals would pad backlogs for years and are often extremely profitable (foreign orders can carry higher margins). 

- **Industrial Base Expansion (Capacity Ramp-Up):** A less obvious catalyst is that a war would force the Pentagon to help contractors **expand production capacity**, possibly via direct investment. We are already seeing early signs: the DoD is urging industry to **open new production lines and suppliers** for missiles ([www.roic.ai](https://www.roic.ai/news/pentagon-pushes-defense-contractors-to-dramatically-ramp-up-missile-production-09-29-2025#:~:text=,intensity%20conflict)). In a protracted Iran conflict, the government could fund factory expansions – e.g. building new assembly lines for rockets or incentivizing hiring/training of skilled labor. For companies, this means government footing some capital expenditure, improving their long-term output and efficiency. For example, if Lockheed gets funded to build a second HIMARS facility or RTX gets new tooling for missile casings, that raises their potential future revenue. In effect, war can lead to a *“government subsidy”* of growth: the last major example was the rapid build-up of mine-resistant vehicle (MRAP) production in 2007–08 – many contractors benefited from government-funded plant expansions which later helped their commercial production. Today, similar efforts might include standing up new **microelectronics and energetics manufacturing** (since missiles need rocket fuel, chips, etc., often bottlenecks). L3Harris (with Aerojet) and Northrop (with its own motor unit) could get funds to **expand rocket motor factories**, letting them deliver more and book more sales. Such capacity investments don’t immediately boost revenue, but they enable the **sustained higher production rates** that underpin multi-year upside for these stocks post-conflict.

In sum, an Iran war could act as a **force-multiplier** on existing demand trends. The most immediate catalyst is **consumables usage** (missiles, interceptors, ammo) driving new orders within weeks. Over a slightly longer term (months to a year), **budget supplemental infusions** and **ally procurement** would swell backlogs and likely profits. Unlike a one-off regional skirmish, a U.S.-Iran war would engage many facets of the military, hence offering **multi-dimensional upside**: from combat aircraft to missiles to cyber/ISR support. The key question is not **if** defense companies benefit, but **how much and how sustainably** – which ties into production capacity and political will (discussed below in Risks). But qualitatively, the scenario represents a **clear demand catalyst** across the board for U.S. defense contractors.

# Risk Factors and Potential Downsides

While a conflict with Iran creates obvious tailwinds for defense, investors must consider several **risk factors** that could impair the sector’s performance or limit upside:

- **“Priced-In” War Premium (Valuation Risk):** Defense stocks have run-up strongly anticipating conflict-driven profits. Valuations are now **well above historic norms** – e.g. Lockheed at ~22× earnings vs ~15× historically ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LMT/LOCKHEED%20MARTIN/pe-ratio#:~:text=2023,20.04)), and RTX’s war rally left it at ~40× GAAP earnings ([ycharts.com](https://ycharts.com/companies/RTX/pe_ratio#:~:text=RTX%20PE%20Ratio%20Analysis%20,00)). If an Iran conflict is **short-lived or contained**, there’s a danger these stocks **give back their war gains**. We saw after the 1991 Gulf War, defense shares quickly retreated once the swift victory was won and no new buildup followed. Similarly in late 2003, sector stocks fell >10% when it became clear the Iraq invasion boost wouldn’t be ongoing ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/29/defense-stocks-have-seen-their-peak/541fb3dc-11b6-4957-ae0d-324226a5347e/#:~:text=The%20fighting%20in%20Iraq%20isn%27t,the%20defense%20stock%20boom%20is)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2003/09/29/defense-stocks-have-seen-their-peak/541fb3dc-11b6-4957-ae0d-324226a5347e/#:~:text=Shares%20of%20Lockheed%20Martin%20Corp,the%20past%20couple%20of%20weeks)). Today’s rich multiples leave **little margin for error** – if the war scenario doesn’t materially exceed what’s already expected, stocks could de-rate. In a bear case where diplomacy prevails or conflict fizzles, defense equities might compress back toward historical P/Es, a double-digit percentage decline from current levels.

- **Production & Supply Chain Constraints:** A major practical risk is that contractors **may not be able to rapidly ramp output**, even with demand in hand. The defense-industrial base has faced shortages of critical components (rocket motors, microchips, energetics) and skilled labor. For example, RTX struggled to boost Stinger missile output in 2022 because some parts suppliers no longer existed. **Doubling or quadrupling production** – as the Pentagon is asking ([www.roic.ai](https://www.roic.ai/news/pentagon-pushes-defense-contractors-to-dramatically-ramp-up-missile-production-09-29-2025#:~:text=,intensity%20conflict)) – **won’t happen overnight**. It requires new machinery, trained workers, and lead time (often 12–24 months or more). If a war generates orders faster than industry can fulfill, revenue could be **back-loaded** or delayed. There’s a risk of **customer frustration** leading to cancellation of some unfunded orders if peace breaks out before delivery (the government might scale back options if the threat diminishes). Also, supply chain stress can mean cost overruns – if contractors pay steep expedite fees or overtime to meet surge demand, margins might suffer. In summary, huge backlogs are a blessing only if companies can convert them to sales; the **execution risk** of ramping production is non-trivial.

- **Political and Budget Risk (Long-Term):** War boosts defense budgets in the near term, but it can also create political currents for **future cuts**. Enormous war spending could worsen U.S. deficits, increasing pressure on Congress to trim defense once the conflict ends. A change in administration or public sentiment (war fatigue) might swing toward **“guns-to-butter”** reallocation. For instance, after long wars (Vietnam, Iraq), defense outlays were eventually slashed. If investors overestimate the **duration of elevated spending**, stocks could fall when a down-cycle hits. Additionally, U.S. domestic politics can inject risk: a fiscal crisis or hard debt ceiling fight might curb or delay defense appropriations. There’s also **regime risk** – if U.S. leadership in 2029 or beyond (post-war) prioritizes deficit reduction, procurement could be a target. In the international arena, some allies might diversify suppliers (e.g. buy European or develop indigenous arms) if U.S. equipment is seen as too conditional. Finally, **export or policy restrictions** could appear – for example, if the conflict escalates, the U.S. might ban certain advanced tech sales to the Middle East (as happened with F-35 to UAE for a while). Such moves would directly hurt companies’ growth prospects in those markets.

- **Program Execution & Cost Risks:** Even amid strong demand, defense contractors face their perennial **execution challenges**. Big programs can run into cost overruns or technical issues, risking profit shortfalls or reputation hits at the worst time. For instance, Lockheed’s **F-35** still has modernization upgrades in progress – schedule slips or engine troubles could incur penalties. Northrop’s **B-21 bomber** is entering flight tests; any delay or overrun could spook investors despite war orders elsewhere. L3Harris is integrating Aerojet – if problems arise in merging production or meeting quality standards for rocket motors, it could both raise costs and imperil new contracts (the Pentagon might hesitate to give more work until integration stabilizes). Also, rapid ramp-ups can themselves cause execution issues – rushing production often leads to quality defects or inefficiencies. During the Iraq War, companies like Boeing had issues with the rushed manufacture of armored trucks (later requiring rework). If Iran conflict orders flood in, we could see **lower margins on urgent contracts**, or even penalties if delivery timelines slip. In sum, there’s a risk that in chasing wartime volume, contractors **stumble on execution**, hurting financial performance and stock sentiment.

- **Geopolitical Escalation or Shock Risks:** An Iran war could have broader consequences that don’t solely favor defense stocks. For example, it might trigger a **global oil price spike** (Iran could mine the Strait of Hormuz) leading to recessionary pressures worldwide. A severe economic downturn or financial crisis could drag down the entire stock market, **defense names included**, regardless of their earnings uptick. Investors should recall 1973 (Yom Kippur War oil shock) – defense budgets rose subsequently, but the market and economy struggled in the near term. If a conflict spirals (e.g. drawing in Russia or proxy attacks on U.S. bases globally), overall market **volatility and risk-aversion** could rise, potentially outweighing sector-specific positives. Another angle: If U.S. forces take significant losses or the conflict becomes unpopular, there is **headline risk** (political calls to cease operations could curtail the duration of the war, limiting the defense opportunity). And while it’s unlikely, any serious **military setbacks** (say an advanced U.S. drone or plane gets shot down or a warship damaged) could initially hurt sentiment for the contractor that made it, until longer-term response (like more orders to replace it) kicks in.

- **Post-Conflict “Cliff” Risk (Duration Risk):** The **length of the war** is crucial. If the conflict ends quickly (e.g. limited U.S. strikes that cripple Iran’s capabilities in a few weeks), the **defense rally could be very short** – stocks might spike on the attack, then peak and decline as the market foresees peaking budgets. This was seen in prior short wars (Gulf War I’s quick win saw defense stocks fall within months ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=match%20at%20L142%20glory%20of,gave%20the%20company%20%24200%20million)) ([www.washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1991/01/22/zeroing-in-on-defense-stocks/3c4161f4-ec7b-4ebd-b30d-ad348036164f/#:~:text=glory%20of%20Persian%20Gulf%20success,gave%20the%20company%20%24200%20million))). A short war could lead to a glut of orders being canceled or scaled back. Conversely, if the war drags on for years, that presents its own risk: over a long conflict, investor focus might shift to **war fatigue and cost**. There’s also the risk of a **ceasefire or regime change in Iran** that ends hostilities abruptly – leaving contractors with potential order cancellations if the urgency evaporates. Essentially, timing the endgame is hard – defense stocks historically perform best **in the run-up and early phase** of conflict, and lag later, so one risks being the last owner when the music stops.

- **Broader Market Rotation and Opportunity Cost:** Lastly, investors should consider that defense stocks, while relatively “safe,” might **underperform other trades** depending on war outcomes. For instance, energy stocks could see even bigger gains if oil shoots up. If inflation resurges due to war and interest rates climb, high-valued equities (including defense, currently richly valued) might suffer a rotation out. Additionally, any **negative PR** – defense contractors being seen as “war profiteers” – could become a political football, perhaps leading to windfall taxes or contract scrutiny (low probability but a headline risk as seen occasionally in past conflicts). 

In summary, while an Iran conflict sets a favorable stage for defense companies, investors must guard against **overpaying for expected news** and be mindful of execution and macro risks. These stocks are not risk-free – supply hiccups, political shifts, or simply a shorter-than-expected war could all undermine the bullish thesis. Balancing the **euphoria with these risks** is key to forming a prudent investment strategy.

# Investment Thesis and Price Targets for Key Stocks

All five defense primes stand to benefit from an Iran war, but their **risk/reward profiles differ**. Below we outline a **bull case, base case, and bear case** for each, followed by our **top picks and strategy**:

**Lockheed Martin (LMT):** *Bull Case:* A protracted Iran conflict prompts multi-year U.S. and allied purchases of Lockheed’s core products – F-35 fighters, THAAD systems, HIMARS rockets, etc. We assume defense budgets swell such that Lockheed’s earnings grow high-single-digits annually (vs ~mid-single digits baseline) for the next few years. In this scenario, LMT could sustain a P/E ~25× given war momentum. On 2026–27 EPS of ~$ thirty (assuming conflict adds ~$2–3 to EPS), a 25× multiple yields a **stock price in the $750+ range**, about 20% upside from current ~$620. *Base Case:* The conflict impact is moderate – Lockheed sees some extra orders but also some delays elsewhere; EPS grows ~5% CAGR and the P/E normalizes to ~20×. That would keep LMT roughly in the **$600–650 range** (today’s price already factors this in). Investors collect the ~2% dividend, but further upside is limited without new catalysts. *Bear Case:* The war is short or doesn’t significantly escalate U.S. involvement. Defense hype falls, and Lockheed’s multiple reverts to its historical ~15×. If EPS is ~$28–30, the stock could pull back to **$450–500** (25%+ downside). This scenario could also materialize post-war if budgets flatten. Overall, Lockheed offers a **balanced** profile: it’s *expensive but high-quality*. It may not have the most explosive upside, but it’s the sector bellwether. We view LMT as a solid **core holding** for a war trade, with relatively lower downside given its diversified backlog and dividend support.

**RTX Corporation (RTX):** *Bull Case:* Raytheon’s unparalleled missile and air-defense portfolio makes it the **“purest play”** on the Iran conflict. In a drawn-out war, RTX could see a tidal wave of orders for Tomahawks, Patriots, AMRAAMs, NASAMS, Iron Dome interceptors, you name it. On top of that, the resolution of Pratt & Whitney’s engine issues boosts earnings. In a bull scenario, RTX’s 2026 EPS might jump to ~$8–9 (from $6.30 in 2025) due to surge sales, and the market could award a ~25× multiple (acknowledging its improved growth). That yields a price around **$200+* (which it’s near now) up to perhaps $230 (~15% upside)**. Notably, RTX already rallied ~80% in anticipation ([responsiblestatecraft.org](https://responsiblestatecraft.org/october-7-hamas-attack/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20these%20weapons%20and,produced%20a%20%248%2C269%20total%20return)), so further upside could be more muted than the initial jump. *Base Case:* War impact is partial – strong missile sales but also some margin pressure from ramp-up costs; Pratt’s recovery offsets some war gains. EPS grows to ~$7 and the stock settles at a more rational 20–22× earnings once excitement cools, implying **$150–160** stock (a pullback, since it overshot). *Bear Case:* If conflict fizzles or is very short, RTX’s valuation could correct sharply. With its current P/E ~40× ([ycharts.com](https://ycharts.com/companies/RTX/pe_ratio#:~:text=RTX%20PE%20Ratio%20Analysis%20,00)), even a drop to 25× on current earnings (~$6) means **$150 or lower**. In a harsh bear case, disappointing execution (e.g. engine fixes cost more) plus fading war orders could push it to low $100s (where it was in 2022–early 2023). In sum, RTX likely has **the highest short-term beta to conflict headlines** – it could pop strongly on any strikes or escalation, but it also has the most to lose valuation-wise if reality under-delivers. For aggressive investors, RTX offers *torque* on an Iran war, but one must monitor it closely (it’s our highest-risk pick of the five).

**Northrop Grumman (NOC):** *Bull Case:* Although Northrop doesn’t scream “Middle East” as much as Raytheon or Lockheed, it could be a **stealth winner**. If the war drives a sizeable increase in overall DoD funding (especially for Air Force and Space), Northrop’s big programs (B-21, GBSD missiles, Space sensors) could get *additional funds* or accelerated timelines. Also, Northrop could win urgent contracts for more Global Hawk UAVs or surveillance services. In a bull case, NOC’s growth accelerates to ~5%+ organic and margin improves, yielding EPS $30+ by 2027. Applying its typical ~20× multiple gives a **$600 stock**, and if investors prize its strategic programs, maybe up to $650 (the stock hit ~$600 in 2022). That’s ~15–20% upside from current ~$540. *Base Case:* Northrop continues on its current trajectory – modest growth, solid execution. War-related gains are offset by any one-offs (e.g. new R&D on B-21). EPS grows to mid-$20s, and a 18–20× P/E keeps the stock roughly **$500–550**. Essentially flat to slightly up. *Bear Case:* If the conflict is short and defense budgets pivot to Navy/Army (Northrop’s exposure is more Air/Space), NOC might lag. Also any program setback (like B-21 delays) could hit the stock. In a bear scenario, EPS stagnates around $22 and a market sell-off could compress P/E to 15× – implying **$330** or so (back to 2020 levels). That’s a significant drop. However, Northrop’s diverse high-end portfolio and current reasonable valuation make a drastic fall less likely unless broad market tanks. Overall, NOC may not skyrocket on an Iran war, but it **provides stable upside** and could be a dark horse if the conflict spurs investments in tech-intensive areas (stealth, space) where Northrop excels. It’s a good **risk-mitigating pick** to pair with more levered names.

**General Dynamics (GD):** *Bull Case:* GD is the most **value-oriented** name here, and while a Middle East war might not directly revolve around tanks or subs, GD could still thrive. A bull case could be driven by two factors: (1) The Pentagon might increase end-strength (troop count) and need more armored vehicles, trucks, artillery etc., benefitting GD’s combat segment (maybe new orders for Abrams tank upgrades, or Stryker vehicles to equip reinforcements or allies). (2) Prolonged global tension boosts Gulfstream jet orders as wealthy clients (governments, corporations in the region) buy jets for secure transport – sustaining GD’s aerospace profits. In a bullish scenario, GD surprises with 8–10% EPS growth, topping $17–$18 in a couple years. Even at a still-conservative 18× multiple, that yields **$300–325**, about where it is now. If market re-rates it to 20× (in line with peers), we could see **$360** (10% upside). *Base Case:* GD remains a slow-but-steady performer. War adds some incremental logistics and munitions contracts but nothing game-changing; Gulfstream sees normal cyclicality. Revenue growth ~3–5%, EPS maybe $16 by 2027. At ~17×, stock would be **$270–280**, a bit below current (we suspect the stock’s recent strength already bakes in a lot of good news). Plus, one must consider GD’s share price may have run due to unrelated factors (business jet cycle) which could soften independently. *Bear Case:* In a scenario where conflict is short and global economy turns down (oil shock -> recession), GD might actually suffer twice: defense orders could cool and business jet sales might slump with a weak economy. GD’s earnings could stagnate ~$15 and P/E slide to 15× or below (investors often treat GD as an industrial when growth stalls). That points to **$225 or lower** (20–30% downside). Still, GD’s dividend and share buybacks (they tend to repurchase stock consistently) provide some support. Net-net, GD is **lower beta to war** – it won’t be the top gainer on Iran news, but it also offers a cushion from its civilian segment and strong financials. For a war trade, GD might be best as an **income play** or a hedge against overly optimistic scenarios (it will hold value if war doesn’t materialize as much as expected).

**L3Harris (LHX):** *Bull Case:* L3Harris is a bit of a hybrid – smaller than the others but more agile in certain niches. In a big Iran war, LHX could disproportionately win classified contracts (for urgent electronic warfare gear, comms uplinks, etc.) and, critically, rake in revenue through Aerojet Rocketdyne as missiles production surges. A bull case might have LHX’s organic growth jump to ~10% with improving margins (scale + Aerojet synergies). If EPS climbs to ~$12–13 by 2027 and the market rewards its growth with a ~20–22× multiple, the stock could hit **$260–285**, roughly 10–15% upside from ~$250 (note: LHX is a bit off its highs currently). Some analysts see LHX as **undervalued relative to peers** given its high-tech focus – war orders could help close that gap. *Base Case:* LHX executes moderately: war orders help but integration costs persist, growth ~5–6%. EPS around $11 in a couple years, and stock stays at ~20× = **$220** (essentially range-bound or slightly down from today’s ~$240–250). *Bear Case:* Integration or execution missteps coincide with a fizzling conflict. If LHX disappoints on earnings (say stays at ~$10 EPS) and the P/E compresses to 15–18× as the war hype fades, the stock could dip to **$150–180** (a sizable drop). Given it’s the highest P/E of the group now ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LHX/l3harris-technologies/pe-ratio#:~:text=L3Harris%20Technologies%20Inc%20PE%20Ratio,2025%20%7C%20LHX)), it has valuation risk if growth doesn’t materialize. But management has a decent record of delivering synergies (post Harris/L3 merger), so the biggest bear risk is simply overpaying for it now. In essence, LHX offers **more upside than GD or NOC** if things go right (due to Aerojet leverage and its tech lineup), but also is a bit more vulnerable if things go wrong. It’s somewhat a **“growth stock”** among defense, and should be sized accordingly in a war trade portfolio.

**Conviction Ranking:** Considering all the above, our **highest-conviction pick** for an Iran war scenario is **Lockheed Martin (LMT)**. It has the broadest exposure to the likely areas of spending (air, missile defense, munitions) and a still reasonable valuation relative to its quality. It’s also less likely to suffer idiosyncratic setbacks. Close behind, **RTX (Raytheon)** is arguably the *biggest direct beneficiary* of conflict (missile defense + offense), but its stock has run hard and carries more near-term risk – we’d rank it #2 with the caveat that one must watch it carefully (it could have the highest short-term upside swings on headline news). **Northrop Grumman** comes in at #3 – a stable pick with good long-term programs; it may not pop as much on Day 1 of a war, but it stands to gain from the overall budget rise and offers a safer valuation. **L3Harris** is #4 – it could surprise to the upside with niche wins, but until it proves the Aerojet deal payoff, we place it slightly lower. Finally, **General Dynamics** is #5 for an Iran-centric thesis – not because it’s a bad company (indeed it’s very solid), but because its war leverage is lowest and its recent appreciation leaves less room for further gains absent a long conflict. 

That said, which stock has *the* best risk/reward depends on one’s time horizon and risk tolerance. **For immediate conflict trading**, RTX might outperform (as seen in early October 2023 when it jumped on war news). **For medium-term fundamental upside with less volatility**, Lockheed and Northrop are attractive. If one is looking for yield and downside cushion, GD is the pick (its 5.4% FCF yield and diversified biz make it resilient ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=match%20at%20L514%20The%20data,safety%2C%20and%20balance%20sheet%20strength)) ([www.metricduck.com](https://www.metricduck.com/blog/defense-contractor-roic-rankings-2025#:~:text=Which%20defense%20contractor%20has%20the,safest%20dividend))). 

**Suggested Strategy:** A balanced approach could be owning a **basket** of these names or simply an aerospace/defense ETF for broader exposure. Notable ETFs include *ITA* (iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense), *PPA* (Invesco Aerospace & Defense), and *XAR* (SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense). These hold similar stocks (ITA’s top holdings are Raytheon ~20%, Lockheed ~17%, Boeing ~15%, etc.). An ETF like ITA provides a one-click exposure to the theme without single-stock risk. However, keep in mind Boeing (which has significant weight in ITA/PPA) is a mixed bag – it would benefit somewhat (as a supplier and with KC-46 tankers, etc.) but it’s primarily a commercial aerospace play. **Thus, a tailored basket** of the pure defense primes might outperform the ETFs if the Iran war thesis plays out strongly. One could also include smaller defense names (like *Mercury Systems*, *Palantir*, or European defense firms) for diversification, but focusing on the big five U.S. primes captures the bulk of the opportunity in a U.S.-Iran conflict scenario.

**Upside/Downside Estimates:** To summarize potential price targets: Under a **bullish extended-war scenario**, we envision roughly **10–20% upside** for LMT/NOC/GD, **15–25%+ upside** for RTX (from its slightly lower current baseline, as it pulled back from highs) and for LHX (if delivering on growth). In a **bear case** (short war or none), downside could be **15–30%** sector-wide as valuations normalize – RTX and LHX likely at the high end of that due to their higher starting multiples, and GD at the low end (maybe <20% drop) thanks to value support. 

Investors should be nimble – these stocks tend to **react fast** to geopolitical developments. It may pay to **build positions ahead of major inflection points** (e.g. diplomatic deadlines, election outcomes influencing war likelihood) and also to **take profits** once the conflict is well underway and defense stocks start to peak (history shows peaks can precede war end by months). Keep an eye on valuation metrics relative to history during the conflict – if P/Es stretch far beyond historical highs, it might signal the market fully pricing in the war outcome.

In conclusion, a war with Iran provides a compelling but **time-sensitive trade** in defense stocks. We’d favor a **Lockheed/RTX combo** (one stable giant + one high-beta missile play) as the core of an Iran conflict trade, supplemented by either Northrop or L3Harris for additional upside. Use of a defense ETF like ITA is an alternative for those who want broad exposure without stock-picking – though note, an ETF will dilute the pure-play effect (including names like Boeing, which won’t move as much on Iran news). Given the complexity, a **diversified approach** across a few of these names, combined with clear exit strategies, is prudent.
