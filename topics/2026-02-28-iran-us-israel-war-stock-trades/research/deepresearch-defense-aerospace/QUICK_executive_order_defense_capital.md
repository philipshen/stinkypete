# Quick Research: Executive Order Impact on Defense Capital Returns

## Question
How strictly will the Jan 2026 EO restricting buybacks/dividends be enforced, which metrics define "underperformance," and which primes (RTX, LMT, GD) are most at risk?

## Findings

- **The EO is real and has teeth.** On January 7, 2026, Trump signed "Prioritizing the Warfighter in Defense Contracting," which immediately prohibits any "major defense contractor" from conducting stock buybacks or issuing dividends "at the expense of accelerated procurement and increased production capacity." The order gave SecDef Pete Hegseth 30 days (by Feb 6, 2026) to produce an initial list of underperforming contractors, with ongoing identification thereafter.

- **Four criteria define "underperformance."** DoD must identify contractors that are: (1) underperforming on their contracts, (2) not investing their own capital into necessary production capacity, (3) not sufficiently prioritizing US government contracts, or (4) whose production speed is insufficient as determined by the Secretary of Defense. If a contractor meets any of these AND engaged in buybacks or distributions during that period, they are flagged.

- **Enforcement mechanisms are substantial.** For identified contractors, the Secretary may pursue remedies "to the maximum extent permitted by law," including actions under the Defense Production Act (DPA), contract enforcement via FAR/DFARS, and -- critically -- the SEC Chairman is directed to consider amending Rule 10b-18 to strip the safe harbor for buybacks from identified companies. Future contracts must prohibit buybacks/distributions during underperformance and tie executive incentive compensation to on-time delivery and production increases rather than EPS or free cash flow.

- **RTX appears most at risk among the primes.** A February 2026 Pentagon assessment found RTX's performance on a key Navy missile program "remains below expectations" despite some improvement. Trump reportedly singled out RTX specifically. The top five defense firms (LMT, NOC, GD, LHX, RTX) collectively paid ~$8B in dividends and bought back ~$10B in shares over the prior 12 months (per Morgan Stanley), making all of them potential targets. However, RTX's documented delivery issues on missile programs make it the most exposed.

- **Practical enforcement remains uncertain.** Multiple law firm analyses (Morgan Lewis, Sidley Austin, Skadden, K&L Gates, Pillsbury) note that the EO's legal authority is primarily prospective -- it can mandate terms in future contracts but retroactive enforcement on existing contracts faces legal challenges. The most immediate impact is reputational and on new contract terms. All primes have publicly stated they remain "committed" to dividends while pledging increased production investment.
