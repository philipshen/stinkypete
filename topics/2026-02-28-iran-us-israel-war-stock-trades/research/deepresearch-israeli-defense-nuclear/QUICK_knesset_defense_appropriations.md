# Quick Research: Israeli Knesset Emergency Defense Appropriations

## Question
What specific emergency defense appropriations has the Israeli Knesset passed since February 28, 2026, and what share flows to Elbit vs. Rafael/IAI?

## Key Findings

### 2026 Base Defense Budget
- **Total:** NIS 112 billion ($34 billion) -- approved by Israeli cabinet in December 2025
- **Context:** Down from IDF's initial request of NIS 140-144 billion ($44.7B)
- **Deficit ceiling:** Raised to 3.9% from 3.2%, authorizing NIS 15 billion ($4.6B) in additional deficit spending
- **Knesset timeline:** First plenary reading completed; full passage deadline end of March 2026

### Emergency Supplemental (Post-Feb 28)
- **No specific post-Feb 28 supplemental has been passed as of the day of strikes** -- the budget was still working through Knesset approval before the escalation
- Israel Defense Ministry was already demanding an additional $2 billion boost prior to Feb 28 to counter Iran's military buildup (per Calcalistech)
- Historical precedent: After Oct 7, 2023, Israel added ~$12.5 billion in emergency defense spending over 2024-2025
- **Expectation:** Emergency supplemental of NIS 20-40 billion ($6-12B) likely given scale of Feb 28 operations

### Allocation Between Contractors (Estimated)
- **No public breakdown** of Israel MoD procurement allocation between Elbit, Rafael, and IAI is available
- Estimated split based on revenue shares and product lines:
  - **Rafael:** Largest share -- produces Iron Dome, David's Sling, Iron Beam, Trophy APS, SPIKE missiles (all critical wartime consumables)
  - **IAI:** Second -- produces Arrow missile defense, Barak systems, Heron UAVs, satellite systems
  - **Elbit:** Third for domestic (but largest export share) -- produces Hermes UAVs, PULS rockets, Iron Sting mortars, C4ISR, ammunition
- Elbit's domestic revenue share shifted from ~20% pre-Oct 7 to ~42% in Q4 2024, reflecting surge in Israel MoD orders
- Rafael and IAI, as state-owned companies, receive direct government procurement that does not always go through competitive bidding

### Implication for Trade Cards
The ESLT trade card should note that while Elbit benefits from domestic emergency spending, it captures a smaller share than Rafael and IAI for the highest-demand wartime systems (missile defense interceptors). Elbit's primary war catalyst is ammunition/munitions (land revenue +41% YoY), UAVs, and PGMs rather than strategic missile defense. The Rafael/IAI IPO question (already in deep research TODO) is the more material factor for ESLT valuation.
