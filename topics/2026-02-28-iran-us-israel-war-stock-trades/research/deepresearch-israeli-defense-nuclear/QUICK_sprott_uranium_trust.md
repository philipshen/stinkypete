# Quick Research: Sprott Physical Uranium Trust Market Activity

## Question
Whether Sprott has been buying aggressively in the spot market and current premium/discount to NAV.

## Findings

- **Aggressive Buying in 2026:** SPUT has been actively acquiring uranium through its at-the-market (ATM) program. In Q1 2026, quarterly purchase volume reached 3.65 million pounds -- the strongest quarterly start since the trust's formation in 2021. A single transaction in early 2026 saw 250,000 lbs purchased at once. Total holdings have grown from ~74.9M lbs in early January to ~78.4-79M lbs by late February 2026.

- **NAV and Premium/Discount:** As of January 22, 2026, total NAV was US$6.62 billion (NAV/unit ~US$20.78) with 318.4M units outstanding. The trust has recently traded at a premium to NAV, which is significant because SPUT can only issue new units and buy physical uranium when trading at or above NAV. Trading at a premium signals strong investor demand and enables the trust's spot market purchasing mechanism.

- **Spot Price Context:** Uranium spot price stands at ~US$89.50/lb as of late February 2026, up 9.1% YTD and 37.2% YoY. The market is characterized by structural supply deficits potentially exceeding 200M lbs/year, with Kazatomprom signaling reduced 2026 production and McArthur River experiencing output delays.

- **Market Significance:** SPUT's total energy metal holdings are now valued at ~$7.28 billion. As the world's largest physical uranium fund, its buying activity is a material price-setting force in the spot market. Continued ATM issuance at premium indicates the trust is absorbing available spot supply, tightening an already constrained market.
