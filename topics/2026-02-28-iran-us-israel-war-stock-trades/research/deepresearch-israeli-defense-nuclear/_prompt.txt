TOPIC: Israeli Defense & Nuclear/Uranium — Elbit Systems, Israeli Defense Ecosystem, and Uranium Plays if Conflict Escalates Toward Nuclear Facilities

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into stock trade ideas stemming from a war between Iran and the United States + Israel (conflict began February 28, 2026). The final output will be an interactive HTML site with trade cards for Israeli defense and nuclear/uranium stocks including investment theses, risk/reward analysis, historical precedents, and citations. This topic covers two related sub-sectors: (1) Israeli defense companies, particularly Elbit Systems (ESLT), that are directly engaged in the conflict, and (2) uranium/nuclear fuel companies (Cameco/CCJ, Uranium Energy Corp/UEC) that could benefit if strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities escalate concerns about nuclear proliferation and fuel security.

Please provide a comprehensive analysis covering:

1. **Elbit Systems (ESLT) — Deep Dive**
   - Current financial position: revenue, earnings, backlog, P/E ratio, market cap (as of early 2026)
   - Key products relevant to Iran conflict: UAVs (Hermes series), precision-guided munitions, electronic warfare systems, C4ISR, Iron Dome components, Trophy active protection system
   - Historical stock performance during Israeli conflicts: 2014 Gaza War, 2021 Guardian of the Walls, 2023-24 Iron Swords, and any 2025-2026 escalation
   - Percentage moves and timeframes after conflict onset
   - Revenue breakdown: Israel vs. international sales
   - Key contracts and recent wins
   - Elbit's role in Israeli defense industrial base vs. Rafael and IAI (government-owned competitors)
   - Risk factors: Israeli operations disruption, employee mobilization (IDF reserves), supply chain in conflict zone, ESG/BDS boycott pressures
   - Bull/base/bear case price targets

2. **Broader Israeli Defense Ecosystem**
   - Rafael Advanced Defense Systems (private) — Iron Dome, David's Sling, Trophy
   - Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI, government-owned) — Arrow missile defense, satellites, UAVs
   - Other publicly traded Israeli defense-adjacent companies: Check Point Software (CHKP), CyberArk (CYBR), Tower Semiconductor (TSEM)
   - How the war economy affects Israeli tech sector broadly
   - Israel's defense budget trajectory and emergency appropriations
   - U.S. military aid to Israel ($3.8B annual + supplementals) and how it flows to specific companies

3. **Uranium & Nuclear Fuel Plays**
   - **Cameco (CCJ)**: World's largest public uranium producer; current financial position, uranium production (McArthur River, Cigar Lake), JV Ventures (Westinghouse nuclear fuel), current stock price, P/E, and valuation
   - **Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)**: U.S.-based junior producer; ISR production capabilities, Christensen Ranch, Roughrider acquisition, current valuation
   - **Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SRUUF/U.UN)**: Physical uranium holding vehicle; premium/discount to NAV
   - **Global Atomic (GLO)**: Emerging producer with Niger operations
   - **NexGen Energy (NXE)**: Arrow deposit in Saskatchewan
   - How strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities (Natanz, Fordow, Isfahan) affect:
     - Uranium spot and term contract prices
     - Nuclear fuel supply chain disruption concerns
     - Sentiment around nuclear proliferation → increased demand for enrichment services
     - Western government urgency to secure domestic/allied uranium supply
   - Current uranium market fundamentals: spot price (~$75-85/lb?), long-term contract prices, supply deficit, utility contracting cycle
   - Historical uranium price moves during geopolitical events (Fukushima crash, Russia-Ukraine war uranium spike)
   - The "security of supply" thesis: Western utilities reducing Russian uranium dependence (TENEX/Rosatom sanctions)
   - HALEU (High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium) demand for next-gen reactors and weapons programs

4. **Iran Nuclear Program Context**
   - Status of Iran's nuclear facilities: Natanz, Fordow, Isfahan, Arak, Bushehr
   - Iran's enrichment levels (60%+ HEU stockpile as of early 2026)
   - How military strikes on nuclear facilities could affect global nuclear fuel markets
   - Risk of radioactive contamination affecting regional sentiment toward nuclear energy
   - Whether destruction of Iranian enrichment capacity removes a future competitor or creates supply disruption

5. **Risk/Reward Analysis**
   - ESLT: risk level, conviction, upside/downside targets
   - CCJ: risk level, conviction, upside/downside targets
   - UEC: risk level, conviction, upside/downside targets
   - Key risks for each position
   - Correlation between these trades and the broader conflict thesis
   - Entry timing considerations

6. **Historical Precedents**
   - How Israeli defense stocks performed during past conflicts
   - How uranium stocks performed during geopolitical crises (2022 Russia-Ukraine, 2011 Fukushima inverse, 2007 uranium bubble)
   - Market reaction patterns: immediate spike vs. sustained move

7. **All source URLs for claims made** — provide specific URLs for financial data, stock prices, uranium prices, company fundamentals, and analyst estimates.

8. **Open questions or areas needing further investigation** — what aspects of the Israeli defense and nuclear/uranium trade theses would benefit from additional research?

Focus on accuracy and cite your sources. Provide specific numbers, dates, and percentages wherever possible rather than vague generalizations.
