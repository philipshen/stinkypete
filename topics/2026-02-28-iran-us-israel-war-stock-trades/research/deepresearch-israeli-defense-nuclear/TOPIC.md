TOPIC: Israeli Defense & Nuclear/Uranium — Elbit Systems, Israeli Defense Ecosystem, and Uranium Plays if Conflict Escalates Toward Nuclear Facilities

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into stock trade ideas stemming from a war between Iran and the United States + Israel. The final output will be an interactive HTML site with trade cards for Israeli defense and nuclear/uranium stocks including investment theses, risk/reward analysis, historical precedents, and citations. This topic covers two related sub-sectors: (1) Israeli defense companies, particularly Elbit Systems (ESLT), that are directly engaged in the conflict, and (2) uranium/nuclear fuel companies (Cameco/CCJ, Uranium Energy Corp/UEC) that could benefit if strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities escalate concerns about nuclear proliferation and fuel security.

Please provide a comprehensive analysis covering the Israeli defense ecosystem, uranium market dynamics, and how an Iran-US/Israel war specifically impacts these stocks, with price targets and citations.
