# Summary: Israeli Defense & Nuclear/Uranium

## Abstract

Elbit Systems (ESLT) is the only major publicly traded Israeli defense company and the single most direct equity play on Israeli wartime demand, with a record $25.2 billion backlog (Q3 2025) and trailing twelve-month revenue of $7.2 billion growing 25% YoY. The stock has surged ~147% over the past year to an all-time high of $769 (Feb 27, 2026), driven by the October 2023 Hamas war, multi-front escalation through 2024-2025, and now the February 2026 Iran-US/Israel conflict. However, the P/E ratio of ~57-72x (depending on methodology) is historically extreme and analyst consensus targets of ~$550 are well below the current price, creating significant downside risk if the conflict de-escalates. On the uranium side, Cameco (CCJ) at ~$118 and Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) at ~$15 are positioned to benefit from the Iran nuclear facility strikes (June 2025 and February 2026), which have elevated nuclear proliferation concerns and accelerated Western governments' urgency to secure domestic uranium supply. Uranium spot prices climbed to $100/lb in January 2026, up from ~$63-83/lb range in mid-2025, supported by structural supply deficits, Kazatomprom production cuts, Russian import bans, and AI datacenter-driven nuclear power demand. CCJ is the "blue chip" uranium play with the Westinghouse nuclear fuel services platform, while UEC offers higher-beta U.S.-centric production exposure but at an earlier stage.

## Key Insights

- **ESLT Has Been the Standout Israel War Stock**: From approximately $310 pre-October 7, 2023, to $769 on February 27, 2026, Elbit Systems has appreciated ~148% over roughly 2.5 years. The stock barely dipped on the initial October 7 attack day (Tel Aviv-35 fell 6.5%, ESLT fell only 3.2%) and gained 6.5% in the following two days. The sustained multi-front conflict (Gaza, Lebanon, Iran) has driven unprecedented domestic demand. [Source: calcalistech.com, macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/ESLT]

- **Record Backlog Provides Multi-Year Visibility**: Elbit's $25.2 billion backlog as of Q3 2025 is a record high, with 69% from international customers and approximately 57% scheduled for execution in 2025-2026. The company has recently won a $2.3 billion international contract (8-year duration), $435 million in defense systems contracts, $260 million for advanced airborne munitions from Israel MoD, and $120 million for Hermes 900 maritime UAVs. [Source: elbitsystems.com, prnewswire.com, israelhayom.com]

- **Valuation is Extremely Stretched -- Main Risk**: ESLT trades at ~57-72x trailing P/E (sources vary), dramatically above the defense sector average (~30x) and its own historical norms. Only 3 analysts cover the stock with an average target of $550, which is 28% below the current price. This disconnect between price and analyst targets signals that the war premium may be overpriced. [Source: stockanalysis.com/stocks/eslt, fullratio.com, public.com/stocks/eslt]

- **BDS/ESG Divestment Headwind is Real but Manageable**: Scotiabank fully divested from ESLT in February 2026, Norway's largest pension fund banned investments, AXA divested, and campaign pressure continues (Capital One "Eject Elbit" campaign). International revenue share shifted from ~80% pre-war to ~58% in Q4 2024, though this partly reflects the massive surge in domestic Israel MoD orders rather than purely lost export contracts. [Source: bdsmovement.net, justpeaceadvocates.ca, calcalistech.com]

- **Operational Risk from Reserve Duty is Declining**: Employee mobilization peaked at ~15% after October 7, 2023 and declined steadily to ~4% by March 2025. Elbit relocated production lines and recruited additional workers. Revenue growth accelerated despite disruptions. [Source: elbitsystems.com Q3 2025 earnings release]

- **Key Products Driving Wartime Demand**: Hermes 900/450 MALE UAVs (20+ operators worldwide), Iron Fist active protection system (counter-drone, anti-RPG), Iron Sting laser-guided mortar munitions, PULS rocket launchers, precision-guided munitions and ammunition (land revenue up 41% YoY in Q3 2025), C4ISR and electronic warfare systems. Aerospace revenues jumped 27% in recent quarters driven specifically by UAS and PGM demand. Note: Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Iron Beam are Rafael products, not Elbit; Trophy is also primarily Rafael. [Source: elbitsystems.com, defense-update.com, timesofisrael.com, Gemini deep research]

- **Rafael and IAI IPOs Could Create Competition for ESLT Capital Flows**: Israel plans to float 25-30% minority stakes in both Rafael and IAI as early as Q2 2026. Rafael reported record sales of $4.8 billion in 2024 (27% increase) with a $17.76 billion backlog and ~50% export share. IAI reported its most profitable year ever: $6.1 billion in sales, $493 million net income (55% surge), and a record $25-26.5 billion backlog. If the IPOs proceed, investors would gain direct exposure to Iron Dome, David's Sling, Arrow missile defense, Iron Beam laser, and other flagship systems -- potentially diluting ESLT's premium as the "only way to play" Israeli defense.

- **Caspian Transport Route Risk is a Hidden Uranium Catalyst**: Iran conflict threatens the Trans-Caspian Transport Route, the primary alternative for getting Kazakh uranium (~40% of global supply) to Western markets without transiting through Russia or China. Marine insurance premiums for Caspian transit have risen sharply, effectively making Kazakh supply more expensive and riskier. This shifts demand toward North American producers (CCJ, UEC) and Canadian development assets (NXE). [Source: Gemini deep research, news.az]

- **Israel's 2026 Defense Budget is $34B (NIS 112B)**: Emergency defense spending has added ~$12.5 billion in 2025-2026. The US has provided $21.7 billion in military aid since October 2023, including $3.8B/year under the existing MOU plus supplementals. This spending directly feeds Elbit through Israel MoD contracts. [Source: timesofisrael.com, fdd.org, cfr.org, costsofwar.watson.brown.edu]

- **Uranium Spot Price Hit $100/lb in January 2026**: After ranging between $63-83/lb through most of 2025, uranium surged to $100/lb by January 2026. The price rose 30.66% YoY. Key drivers: Kazatomprom production cuts (~20% below prior guidance), Russian import ban (December 2027 deadline approaching), AI datacenter nuclear power demand, Trump executive order to quadruple nuclear energy by 2050, and $2.7B in DOE contracts for domestic enrichment. [Source: tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uranium, sprott.com, ans.org]

- **Iran Nuclear Facility Strikes Add Geopolitical Premium to Uranium**: The June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer (US B-2 strikes on Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan) and the February 2026 escalation have elevated concerns about nuclear proliferation and fuel security. While Iran was not a uranium supplier to Western markets, the strikes: (1) heightened urgency around securing non-Russian enrichment capacity, (2) increased geopolitical risk premium on uranium, and (3) accelerated Western government investment in domestic nuclear fuel supply chains. [Source: en.wikipedia.org/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites, csis.org, aljazeera.com]

- **CCJ is the Premier Uranium "Blue Chip"**: Cameco's 2025 revenue was $3.48B (+11% YoY), earnings $589.6M (+243%). The company owns McArthur River (world's largest high-grade mine) and Cigar Lake (highest-grade mine), plus a 49% stake in Westinghouse nuclear fuel services. 2026 production guidance: 14-16.5M lbs at McArthur River and 17.5-18M lbs at Cigar Lake (100% basis). P/E of ~110-117x is expensive on a trailing basis but the PEG ratio of 0.28 (with EPS growth of 47% expected in 2026 and 33% in 2027) suggests growth-adjusted value. Analyst consensus: Strong Buy with $124 average target. [Source: cameco.com, stockanalysis.com/stocks/ccj, fool.com, yahoo.com/quote/CCJ]

- **UEC is the Highest-Beta U.S. Uranium Play**: Uranium Energy Corp is the largest U.S. uranium producer via ISR mining. Q1 FY2026 production: 68,612 lbs U3O8 at $34.35/lb total cost ($29.90 cash cost). Currently ramping Christensen Ranch (Wyoming) and advancing Burke Hollow (Texas). No hedging strategy means full exposure to uranium price upside. Market cap ~$5.2B, stock at $15.23 (all-time high $20.34 in Jan 2026). Analyst consensus: Buy with $16.69 target. [Source: prnewswire.com, stockanalysis.com/stocks/uec, cnbc.com/quotes/UEC]

- **Uranium Supply Deficit is Structural**: Global mine production meets only ~90% of reactor demand. Kazatomprom (38% of world supply) has cut guidance 20M+ lbs below prior targets. Russia controls ~44% of global enrichment capacity and ~40% of HALEU production. The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act (signed May 2024) and $2.7B DOE enrichment investment (January 2026) are accelerating Western supply chain buildout. [Source: sprott.com/insights/uranium-outlook-2026, energy.gov, utilitydive.com]

- **Historical Precedent: Uranium Spikes on Geopolitical Shocks, Crashes on Accidents**: Russia-Ukraine invasion (2022): CCJ +29%, UEC +36% YTD, uranium price +25% (to $56.70). Fukushima (2011): uranium crashed from $70 to $50 immediately, then bottomed at $18 by 2016 -- a decade-long bear market. The Iran strikes are more analogous to 2022 (supply security narrative) than 2011 (demand destruction narrative). [Source: investorplace.com, fool.com, pillsburylaw.com]

**Status:** Escalated to deep research
Multi-variable analysis (timing, valuation, capital flows). Added to TODO.

### What is the specific revenue and earnings impact on ESLT from the February 28, 2026 escalation vs. what was already reflected in the stock price from prior conflicts?
**Status:** Filtered
Forward earnings unknowable until Q4 FY2025/Q1 FY2026 reports. ESLT already at 57-72x P/E, meaning significant war premium already priced in. Analytical decomposition between priced vs unpriced war demand is addressed in final synthesis.

### What portion of the uranium price is geopolitical premium versus fundamental supply-demand?
**Status:** Escalated to deep research
Analytical decomposition requiring multiple data sources. Added to TODO.

### What is the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust's current buying activity and market impact?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
SPUT has been buying aggressively -- Q1 2026 was its strongest quarterly start since formation, purchasing 3.65M lbs (total ~78-79M lbs). Trading at a premium to NAV ($6.62B), enabling ATM issuance and continued spot buying. Uranium spot at ~$89.50/lb with structural supply deficit >200M lbs/year. See [details](./QUICK_sprott_uranium_trust.md).

### What specific emergency defense appropriations has the Israeli Knesset passed since February 28, 2026, and what share flows to Elbit vs. Rafael/IAI?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
2026 base defense budget: NIS 112B ($34B), approved by cabinet Dec 2025, still working through Knesset. No post-Feb 28 supplemental yet. Defense Ministry was demanding additional $2B pre-strikes. No public breakdown of Elbit vs Rafael/IAI allocation, but Rafael and IAI (state-owned) capture largest domestic share for strategic missile defense systems. Elbit's domestic share rose from ~20% to ~42% post-Oct 2023. See [details](./QUICK_knesset_defense_appropriations.md).

### What is UEC's ISR production ramp status at Christensen Ranch and Burke Hollow?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
Christensen Ranch produced ~199K lbs cumulative since Aug 2024 restart, Q1 FY2026 output of 68,612 lbs at $29.90/lb cash cost. Burke Hollow IX construction substantially complete, first production expected Q2 FY2026. Ramp broadly on track but back-half weighted -- "step-change" expected Q3/Q4 FY2026. No full-year guidance given. See [details](./QUICK_uec_isr_production.md).

### Will the IAEA confirm the status of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, and could confirmation that material was moved before strikes reduce the nuclear proliferation premium on uranium?
**Status:** Filtered
Speculative/unknowable -- IAEA inspection access and findings cannot be predicted. Nuclear proliferation premium dynamics addressed in the uranium price decomposition deep research item.

### Have the Trump nuclear executive orders translated into concrete procurement actions?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
The May 2025 EOs have translated into concrete action: $2.7B DOE enrichment contracts (Jan 2026) to Centrus ($900M), General Matter ($900M), Orano ($900M) for LEU/HALEU capacity. DOE committed 20 MT HALEU to AI infrastructure fuel bank. Defense Production Act procurement framework now in place. 2026-2027 should see increased utility term contracting. See [details](./QUICK_trump_nuclear_eo_procurement.md).
