# Quick Research: UEC ISR Production Ramp Progress

## Question
Whether Christensen Ranch and Burke Hollow ISR production ramp rates are on track for 2026.

## Findings

- **Christensen Ranch (Wyoming):** Restarted in August 2024. As of October 31, 2025 (Q1 FY2026), accumulated production was ~199,000 lbs U3O8. Q1 FY2026 production was 68,612 lbs at a cash cost of $29.90/lb. Mine development is advancing with active well installation in wellfields 11 and 12, delineation drilling in wellfields 8 and 10-extensions, and construction of six new header houses. Process upgrades at the Irigaray CPP include a full rebuild of one of two yellowcake thickeners and multiple calciner component repairs, expected to support higher throughput rates.

- **Burke Hollow (South Texas):** Nearing operational status as of Q1 FY2026. The IX (ion exchange) plant construction is substantially complete -- all large-diameter tanks installed, disposal well tested with state regulatory agency present, three-phase power installed and energized. Management expects Burke Hollow to begin initial operations in Q2 FY2026 (calendar Q1 2026), with a meaningful step-change in production cadence expected in Q3 and Q4 FY2026 (calendar Q2-Q3 2026).

- **Production Trajectory:** UEC has not provided specific full-year FY2026 production guidance in total pounds. However, the company has signaled that the second half of FY2026 will see materially higher output as Burke Hollow commences production and Christensen Ranch continues ramping. The Ludeman project in Wyoming is also expected to contribute to the ramp. The company held 1.36M lbs of uranium inventory as of Q1 FY2026 end.

- **Assessment:** The ramp appears broadly on track but remains back-half-weighted. Burke Hollow first production in Q2 is a key near-term catalyst. Christensen Ranch's ~199K lbs cumulative production over 14 months is modest, suggesting the ramp has been gradual rather than rapid -- the CPP upgrades and new wellfield development should accelerate output in coming quarters.
