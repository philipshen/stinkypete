# Quick Research: Trump Nuclear EO to Uranium Procurement Contracts

## Question
How the executive order to quadruple nuclear energy by 2050 translates to concrete uranium procurement contracts in 2026-2027.

## Findings

- **Executive Orders (May 23, 2025):** President Trump signed four EOs targeting 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 (up from ~100 GW today). Key mechanisms: Defense Production Act authority for cooperative LEU/HALEU procurement, 18-month NRC licensing deadlines, reactor pilot program (3 experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026), DOE mandate to expand domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacity, and authorization for reactors on federal lands.

- **$2.7 Billion DOE Enrichment Contracts (January 2026):** The DOE issued its first production-scale task orders under a $2.7B uranium enrichment program. Awards of ~$900M each went to: (1) Centrus Energy (American Centrifuge Operating) for HALEU enrichment capacity, (2) General Matter (startup) for HALEU enrichment, and (3) Orano Federal Services for LEU enrichment expansion. Additionally, $28M was awarded to Global Laser Enrichment for next-gen enrichment technology. Notably, Urenco USA was excluded from this round despite producing ~1/3 of US enriched uranium supply.

- **HALEU Fuel Bank:** DOE committed to releasing at least 20 metric tons of HALEU into a fuel bank for private-sector projects, specifically targeting AI infrastructure at DOE sites. This creates a concrete near-term demand signal for HALEU producers.

- **Defense Production Act Implementation:** Within 30 days of the May 2025 EOs, DOE was directed to seek voluntary agreements with US nuclear companies for cooperative LEU/HALEU procurement. Within 120 days, DOE was required to develop a plan for expanded domestic uranium processing and enrichment for civilian and defense needs (LEU, HEU, HALEU). These deadlines have now passed, meaning the institutional framework for procurement is in place.

- **Implications for Uranium Demand:** The 4x capacity target implies massive incremental uranium demand over the coming decades. The $2.7B in enrichment contracts is the most concrete near-term translation of EO intent into procurement action. For upstream uranium miners (like UEC, CCJ, NXE), the enrichment buildout implies growing feedstock demand for natural uranium, though the immediate beneficiaries are enrichment companies (Centrus, Orano). Utility contracting cycles for natural uranium typically run 2-3 years ahead, suggesting 2026-2027 should see increased utility term contracting activity driven by policy certainty.
