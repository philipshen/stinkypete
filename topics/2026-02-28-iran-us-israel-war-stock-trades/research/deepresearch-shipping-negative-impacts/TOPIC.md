TOPIC: Shipping, Supply Chain & Negative Impacts — Strait of Hormuz/Red Sea shipping disruptions, airline/travel stocks to short, emerging market exposure risks

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into stock trades positioned for a potential Iran-US/Israel military conflict. The final output is an interactive HTML file with trade cards for each ticker, including thesis, risk level, conviction, risk/reward, historical precedent, and citations. This specific topic covers two key areas: (1) Shipping/Logistics stocks that benefit from tanker rate spikes and supply chain disruptions (Frontline FRO, Scorpio Tankers STNG, DHT Holdings DHT, International Seaways INSW, Nordic American Tankers NAT), and (2) Shorts/Hedges — stocks that would be hurt by the conflict including airlines (DAL, UAL, AAL), cruise lines (RCL, CCL, NCLH), online travel agencies (BKNG, EXPE), Gulf-exposed carriers (Emirates via Dubai hub disruption), and emerging market ETFs exposed to oil import shocks (TUR, INDA, EEM).

Please provide:
1. Comprehensive analysis of how shipping/tanker rates respond to Middle East military conflicts and Strait of Hormuz disruptions
2. War risk insurance premium dynamics and their impact on shipping economics
3. For each tanker stock (FRO, STNG, DHT, INSW, NAT): fleet composition, current earnings, breakeven rates, and upside potential from Hormuz disruption
4. Container shipping impact analysis (Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd overcapacity vs. rate spike from rerouting)
5. Airlines to short: fuel cost sensitivity, Middle East airspace closure impact, hedging positions for DAL, UAL, AAL
6. Cruise line exposure: RCL, CCL, NCLH fuel cost impact, itinerary disruptions, consumer confidence effects
7. Online travel agencies: BKNG, EXPE Middle East booking exposure and demand destruction risks
8. Emerging market ETF vulnerability: TUR (Turkey border/trade exposure), INDA (India oil import dependence), EEM (broad EM oil sensitivity)
9. Historical precedents: How these sectors performed during Gulf War 1990-91, Red Sea Houthi crisis 2023-25, and past Hormuz threats
