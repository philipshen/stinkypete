# Quick Research: Airline Fuel Hedging Book Sizes Q4 2025

## Question
What are the actual hedge percentages and strike prices for DAL, UAL, and AAL, and what is the magnitude of earnings impact from an oil price spike?

## Findings
- **All three major US carriers (DAL, UAL, AAL) are effectively unhedged via traditional financial derivatives.** None of the Big Three pursued meaningful fuel hedging programs heading into 2025-2026. American Airlines has maintained a formal no-hedging policy for years. United and Delta similarly do not carry significant hedge books.
- **Delta's Trainer refinery acts as a partial physical hedge.** Delta owns Monroe Energy's Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery, which supplies roughly 40-50% of Delta's domestic jet fuel needs. This vertical integration provides a natural (non-financial) hedge, but it does not protect against crack spread compression or crude price spikes -- it primarily hedges the refining margin. Delta's CFO Paul Jacobson has stated: "We're not pursuing any hedging and think that we're in a very good position."
- **Q4 2025 fuel cost per gallon benchmarks:** United Airlines reported an average fuel price of $2.49/gallon for full-year 2025. American Airlines reported $2.42/gallon in Q4 2025 (up from $2.34 YoY). These serve as the baseline from which any oil spike would create incremental cost pressure.
- **Oil price sensitivity is massive for unhedged carriers.** United Airlines' own disclosures indicate that a $10/barrel move in crude oil prices can translate to hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental annual fuel expense. With all three carriers essentially unhedged, a sustained $20-30/barrel spike (e.g., from $70 to $90-100 Brent) could wipe out $1-3 billion in combined annual operating income across DAL, UAL, and AAL. AAL is the most vulnerable given its weaker balance sheet and thinner margins (Q4 2025 EPS of only $0.16 vs. UAL's $3.10).
- **Key implication for Iran-US/Israel conflict trade:** The lack of hedging across all three carriers means oil price spikes flow almost immediately to the income statement. There is no hedge book cushion to delay the earnings impact. DAL has partial protection via the refinery, UAL has the strongest overall earnings power to absorb a hit, and AAL is the most exposed to a margin squeeze.
