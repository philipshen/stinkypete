# Quick Research: European Defense ETFs for Allied Spending Capture

## Question
How do foreign-listed defense ETFs (European defense funds) compare for capturing allied spending increases triggered by the Iran conflict?

## Key Findings

### Top European Defense ETFs

#### EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF)
- **12-month return:** 66.3% (as of Feb 12, 2026)
- **2025 YTD return:** 73-91% (varying by measurement date)
- **AUM:** $1.4 billion
- **Expense ratio:** 0.50%
- **Holdings:** Only 13 stocks, ~94% large-cap growth
- **Top 3:** Airbus SE, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Rheinmetall AG
- **US-listed:** Yes (NYSE Arca)

#### WDEF (WisdomTree Global Defense ETF)
- Global exposure including both US and European defense names
- Broader diversification than EUAD

#### SHLD (Global X Defense Tech ETF)
- Focus on defense technology globally
- Includes both US and allied defense companies

### European Defense Spending Context
- **23 NATO members** now at or above 2% GDP defense spending target
- **NATO target shifting to 5% of GDP** (from prior 2%)
- Goldman Sachs: Euro area defense spending rising from 1.8% (2024) to 2.4% (2027) = ~EUR 80B/year increase
- European defense budgets growing faster than US defense in percentage terms

### Key European Defense Stocks (via EUAD)
- **Rheinmetall (RHM.DE):** German ammunition and armored vehicles. Largest European defense pure-play. +150% in 2025.
- **BAE Systems (BA.L):** UK's largest defense contractor. Nuclear submarines, fighter aircraft.
- **Leonardo (LDO.MI):** Italian aerospace/defense. Helicopters, electronics.
- **Thales (HO.PA):** French defense electronics, cyber, space.
- **Saab AB (SAAB.ST):** Swedish defense. Gripen fighter, submarines.

### Relevance to Iran Conflict
- European allies would increase readiness spending in response to broader Middle East instability
- NATO Article 5 concerns if conflict escalates to involve allied forces or assets
- European missile defense demand increases (THAAD/Patriot alternatives, Aster/SAMP-T)
- However, European defense companies are **less directly leveraged** to Iran-specific war demand than US primes (LMT, RTX, NOC)

### Implication for Trade Cards
EUAD is a viable **secondary** trade card for the "Allied Spending" theme but is NOT a primary Iran-war play. The direct beneficiaries of an Iran-US/Israel war are US defense primes (which supply the munitions and missile defense systems being consumed). European defense stocks benefit more from the **structural** NATO spending increase that the conflict accelerates. Include as a supplementary "Allied Defense Spending" card with MEDIUM conviction rather than a core war trade.
