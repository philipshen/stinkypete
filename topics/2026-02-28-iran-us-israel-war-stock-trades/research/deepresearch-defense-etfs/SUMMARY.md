# Summary: Defense ETFs vs Individual Stock Picks

## Abstract

Defense ETFs ITA, PPA, and XAR differ dramatically in their suitability for an Iran war trade due to divergent weighting methodologies and Boeing/GE commercial aerospace drag. ITA is structurally flawed for this thesis (~30% of weight in GE Aerospace and Boeing, which are majority commercial-revenue companies hurt by war-related oil spikes and air travel disruption). XAR offers the purest ETF proxy with its equal-weight methodology minimizing Boeing to ~3.3% and elevating mid-cap defense pure-plays, while PPA sits in the middle. For maximum thesis capture, a blended approach of individual prime contractors (LMT, RTX, NOC) plus XAR for supply-chain breadth is recommended over any single ETF.

## Key Insights

- **ITA is NOT recommended for a war trade**: GE Aerospace (21% weight, ~75% commercial revenue) and Boeing (7.7%, ~60% commercial) mean ~30% of ITA is positively correlated with global air travel -- which collapses during Middle East conflicts. Defense purity score: ~45-50%. [Source: https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs]

- **XAR is the best ETF vehicle**: Modified equal-weight methodology caps Boeing at ~3.3%, elevates mid-cap defense suppliers (Kratos, AeroVironment, Huntington Ingalls), and delivers the highest defense purity (~65-70%). Lowest expense ratio at 0.35%. YTD 2026: +15-17%, outperforming ITA (+12-13%) and PPA (+14-16%). [Source: https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/]

- **Boeing drag is quantifiable**: At ~8% weight in ITA/PPA, a 10% Boeing decline shaves ~0.8% off fund returns. Boeing's commercial segment (~46% of revenue) is negatively exposed to war (oil spikes, airspace closures, delayed orders), creating a structural headwind that offsets any defense contract upside.

- **Individual stocks outperform ETFs in conflict spikes**: During the Oct 2023 Hamas-Israel outbreak, LMT jumped 8-10% while ETFs gained only 4-5%, demonstrating ETF dilution. Individual defense primes capture 100% of the war thesis without commercial drag. [Source: https://www.zacks.com/]

- **PPA offers moderate purity with higher costs**: Modified market-cap weighting puts LMT as #1 holding (~9%), but still carries ~17% combined GE/Boeing weight. Expense ratio of 0.58% is highest of the three. Defense purity: ~55-60%. [Source: https://www.invesco.com/]

- **Blended approach is optimal**: 60% individual primes (LMT, RTX, NOC for missile defense/munitions), 40% XAR (broad industrial base/supply chain mid-caps). This eliminates GE/Boeing drag while capturing both prime contractor stability and mid-cap growth. [Source: Synthesized from both Gemini and OpenAI research]

- **ETF composition comparison**: ITA top-10 = 75% concentration (market-cap heavy); PPA top-10 = 61% (modified cap); XAR top-10 = 38% (equal-weight). Lower concentration = less single-stock risk but also less exposure to mega-cap defense primes. [Source: https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/holdings/]

- **Trade card data points**: XAR entry zone $278-282, target $320-326 (+15-20%), stop-loss $258. PPA entry $178-181, target $210 (+15%), stop-loss $168. ITA at ~$241 but not recommended for this thesis. Position sizing: 5-10% portfolio allocation for ETF-based trades.

## Open Questions

### How quickly do ETF compositions rebalance after a major geopolitical event -- could Boeing's weight in ITA shrink if BA drops significantly?
**Status:** Filtered
Tangential to trade card format. ITA is already NOT recommended per the summary analysis. Boeing weight dynamics are moot for the recommended XAR/individual primes approach.

### What is the options market implying for ITA vs XAR vol surfaces -- are XAR options pricing in higher upside skew?
**Status:** Filtered
Outside scope -- DESIRED_OUTPUT covers trade cards with tickers/theses, not options strategy analysis.

### How does the Jan 2026 Executive Order restricting defense contractor buybacks/dividends affect the relative attractiveness of ETFs vs individual picks?
**Status:** Filtered
Already covered in deepresearch-defense-aerospace QUICK_executive_order_defense_capital.md. EO affects individual names (RTX most exposed, GD safest), not ETF structure.

### Are there leveraged defense ETFs (e.g., DFEN 3x) that could amplify the war trade, and what are the decay risks?
**Status:** Filtered
Outside scope -- DESIRED_OUTPUT covers individual trade ideas, not leveraged product mechanics or portfolio construction.

### How do foreign-listed defense ETFs (European defense funds) compare for capturing allied spending increases triggered by the Iran conflict?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF) returned 66-91% in 2025, $1.4B AUM, 0.50% expense ratio, 13 holdings (Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Rheinmetall). NATO spending rising from 1.8% to 2.4% GDP by 2027 (~EUR 80B/year increase). EUAD is a viable secondary trade card for "Allied Defense Spending" theme but NOT a primary Iran-war play -- US primes capture direct wartime demand. See [details](./QUICK_european_defense_etfs.md).

### What is the historical mean reversion timeline for defense ETF outperformance after geopolitical spikes -- when does the "sell the news" effect kick in?
**Status:** Filtered
Analytical framing -- addressed in final synthesis. Historical precedents research already covers sector rotation timelines (Phase 1-3 pattern) and mean reversion dynamics.

### Could Boeing's defense segment (BDS) be spun off, and how would that restructuring change ETF compositions?
**Status:** Filtered
Speculative/unknowable -- hypothetical corporate action with no announced plans. Tangential to trade card format.

### What is the tax efficiency comparison between holding XAR vs a basket of 5 individual defense stocks in a taxable account?
**Status:** Filtered
Outside scope -- DESIRED_OUTPUT covers individual trade ideas, not portfolio construction or tax optimization.
