## 1. ETF Composition Analysis (ITA, PPA, XAR)  
**ITA (iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF)** – Tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index with ~38 U.S. stocks ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=records%20in%20the%20category%2C%20having,HWM%29%20being)). It is *market-cap weighted*, leading to a concentrated portfolio. The top 10 holdings make up about 76% of assets ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=annualized%20five,year%20return%20of%2010.3)). As of late 2025, **GE Aerospace** was the largest holding (~22% weight), **RTX (Raytheon Technologies)** ~16%, and **Boeing (BA)** ~7% ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=However%2C%20ITA%20is%20weighted%20by,largest%20holding%20at%20just%204.8)). Other major components include **Lockheed Martin (LMT)** and **Howmet Aerospace (HWM)** at ~5% each ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=However%2C%20ITA%20is%20weighted%20by,largest%20holding%20at%20just%204.8)). ITA’s expense ratio is 0.38% ([www.mezzi.com](https://www.mezzi.com/blog/ita-vs-ppa-vs-xar-defense-aerospace-etf-cyclical-upswings#:~:text=,is%20more%20volatile%20but%20has)), and its assets under management (AUM) were about $5.9 B in early 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=ITA%20has%20been%20around%20since,billion%20in%20assets%20under%20management)) (growing to ~$15 B by 2026). The heavy weighting in a few large names reflects its market-cap methodology.  

**PPA (Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF)** – Tracks the SPADE Defense Index, holding around 52–60 stocks (59 as of Dec 2025) ([www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/etf/PPA/summary#:~:text=PE%20Ratio%3A%2015,TRADED%20FUND%20TRUST)). It uses a *modified market-cap weighting* to prevent any one company from dominating ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=While%20the%20index%20has%20historical,at%20the%20Invesco%20provider%20site)). This results in a more balanced portfolio than ITA. The top 10 holdings account for ~52–62% of assets ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=return%20of%2014.8,year%20return%20of%2013.3)) ([www.bestetf.net](https://www.bestetf.net/etf/PPA/holdings/#:~:text=62%20Assets)), versus ITA’s ~76%. For example, **RTX, LMT,** and **Boeing** are among the largest positions but each only around 7–9% of the fund (Boeing about 5–9% at recent weights) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=PPA%20holds%2052%20stocks%2C%20and,holdings%20using%20TipRanks%E2%80%99%20holdings%20tool)) ([www.bestetf.net](https://www.bestetf.net/etf/PPA/holdings/#:~:text=,0.70%25%20%20%7C%20619.86M)). Other top holdings include **Northrop Grumman (NOC)** and **General Dynamics (GD)** (~5–6%). PPA’s expense ratio is higher at 0.58% ([www.mezzi.com](https://www.mezzi.com/blog/ita-vs-ppa-vs-xar-defense-aerospace-etf-cyclical-upswings#:~:text=stability%20and%20exposure%20to%20top,35)), and AUM was about $2.6 B in early 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Invesco%E2%80%99s%20PPA%20launched%20in%202005,%E2%80%9D)) (now roughly $8 B as defense investing surged). The index methodology limits the influence of the biggest diversified firms, creating a broader exposure base ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=While%20the%20index%20has%20historical,at%20the%20Invesco%20provider%20site)).  

**XAR (SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF)** – Tracks the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index, which is a *modified equal-weight* index ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=that%2C%20before%20fees%20and%20expenses%2C,cap%20stocks.%E2%80%9D)). XAR holds ~35–42 stocks (42 as of 2026) ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/holdings/#:~:text=XAR%20Holdings%20Information)), spreading weight roughly evenly across large and small companies. Its top 10 holdings combine to only ~38–42% of the fund ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=ITA%2C%20XAR%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20massive,of%20XAR%27s%20top%2010%20positions)) ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/holdings/#:~:text=XAR%20Holdings%20Information)), reflecting far less concentration. Recent top holdings (post rebalancing) were each about 3–4% weight, including **Lockheed Martin** (~4.1%), **ATI Inc.** (~4.0%), **Woodward (WWD)** (~3.9%), **Howmet** (~3.8%), **Huntington Ingalls (HII)** (~3.8%), **Northrop** (~3.7%), **Curtiss-Wright (CW)** (~3.6%), **Carpenter Tech (CRS)** (~3.6%), **Boeing** (~3.6%), and **L3Harris (LHX)** (~3.6%) ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/#:~:text=Name%20%20,3.65)) ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/#:~:text=Huntington%20Ingalls%20Industries%2C%20Inc,View%20More%20Holdings)). Because of equal weighting, even smaller mid-cap names (like component suppliers) have similar influence as the giants. XAR’s expense ratio is the lowest at 0.35% ([www.mezzi.com](https://www.mezzi.com/blog/ita-vs-ppa-vs-xar-defense-aerospace-etf-cyclical-upswings#:~:text=and%20cybersecurity,35)), and AUM was about $1.9 B in early 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=This%20brings%20us%20to%20the,billion%20in%20assets%20under%20management)) (now ~$5–6 B). This ETF provides more diversified industry exposure across the defense *and* aerospace supply chain.  

## 2. Boeing Drag Problem (Commercial Exposure Dilution)  
**Boeing’s weight in each ETF:** Boeing (BA) has a significantly different weight in these funds. In ITA, Boeing was historically a top holding (around 16–17% of the fund in late 2023) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=As%20you%20can%20see%2C%20it%27s,respectively)). PPA holds Boeing at a more modest ~5% of assets ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=PPA%20holds%2052%20stocks%2C%20and,holdings%20using%20TipRanks%E2%80%99%20holdings%20tool)), and in XAR Boeing is typically ~3–4% due to the equal-weight approach ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=This%20modified%20equal,of%20XAR%27s%20top%2010%20positions)). This means ITA investors are far more exposed to Boeing’s fortunes than those in PPA or XAR.  

**Commercial vs Defense mix:** Boeing is not a pure defense company – only about one-third of its revenue comes from its Defense, Space & Security division, while ~60–70% is from commercial airplanes and services ([insight.factset.com](https://insight.factset.com/how-much-do-government-contracts-contribute-to-defense-suppliers-revenue-share#:~:text=%2A%20Commercial%20Airplanes%20%28BCA%29%3A%2039.2,8)). In a war-related trade, this is critical because Boeing’s commercial aviation business can be negatively impacted by conflict (e.g. reduced air travel, higher fuel costs, supply chain disruptions). Essentially, a war can hurt the commercial aerospace outlook even as it boosts defense spending. This dynamic can **dilute the upside** for Boeing’s stock during conflicts. For example, in early 2024 Boeing faced a string of setbacks (safety incidents and production issues) that led analysts to downgrade the stock ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Overall%2C%20this%20has%20been%20a,airplanes%20at%20Chicago%E2%80%99s%20O%E2%80%99Hare%20airport)). While pure defense stocks were climbing on geopolitical tensions, Boeing’s troubles and its civil aviation exposure meant it lagged – a headwind for ITA given Boeing’s outsized weighting ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Overall%2C%20this%20has%20been%20a,airplanes%20at%20Chicago%E2%80%99s%20O%E2%80%99Hare%20airport)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20ITA%20features%20an%20expense,intermediate%20term)).  

**Impact on ETF performance:** A large Boeing allocation can drag an aerospace & defense ETF when Boeing underperforms. If defense contractors’ stocks surge on war news but Boeing’s stock stays flat or falls, an ETF like ITA will see a muted net gain relative to an ETF with less Boeing. Analysts have flagged Boeing’s issues as a **concern for ITA** – one report noted that ITA’s “outsized position in Boeing could be a headwind in the short-to-intermediate term” ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Overall%2C%20this%20has%20been%20a,airplanes%20at%20Chicago%E2%80%99s%20O%E2%80%99Hare%20airport)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=average%20ITA%20stock%20price%20target,upside%20potential)). By contrast, XAR and PPA, with Boeing at only ~3–5%, are less affected by Boeing’s volatility ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=This%20modified%20equal,of%20XAR%27s%20top%2010%20positions)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=holdings%20tool)). To quantify the drag: when Boeing was ~16% of ITA, a 10% drop in Boeing would directly shave about 1.6% off ITA’s value (all else equal). We saw this play out in late 2023 – Boeing’s struggles kept ITA’s returns in check, whereas PPA and XAR (lighter on Boeing) were free to rally more on pure-defense strength.  

## 3. YTD 2026 and Recent Geopolitical Performance  
**Year-to-date 2026:** Defense ETFs have started 2026 strong. As of mid-February 2026, ITA was up about +8.4% year-to-date ([www.ishares.com](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239502/ishares-us-aerospace-defense-etf#:~:text=,41)). PPA and XAR have similarly risen in the high-single digits to low-teens percentage range YTD (consistent with ITA, given a broad defense rally). This positive momentum comes on the heels of robust 2025 gains. Notably, **XAR returned +58.6% in the past 12 months** (through early 2026) ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/#:~:text=XAR%20had%20a%20total%20return,22)), and **PPA jumped roughly +47% over the same period** ([companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/invesco-aerospace-defense-etf/holdings/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Invesco%20Aerospace%20%26%20Defense,Invesco%20Aerospace)), reflecting the surge in defense stocks. Such performance far outpaced the overall market, driven by heightened military spending and investor positioning for conflict-related upside.  

**October 2023 (Hamas–Israel conflict):** All three ETFs spiked during the October 2023 Gaza conflict. In the days after the Hamas attack (Oct 7, 2023), investors poured into defense names as a geopolitical hedge ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=Together%2C%20these%20developments%20have%20created,drive%20very%20different%20performance%20outcomes)). ITA, PPA, and XAR each saw a sharp bump – roughly on the order of mid-single-digit percentage gains in the immediate aftermath – while the broader market wobbled. PPA and XAR had particularly clean run-ups given their lesser Boeing exposure; their broader mix of defense contractors benefited directly from the unrest. These funds continued to climb through late 2023 as it became clear that global defense spending was on the rise. For instance, by year-end 2023, **PPA had outperformed both ITA and XAR on a multi-year basis**, boasting a 3-year annualized return of ~12.1% versus ~11.2% for ITA ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=PPA%20has%20outperformed%20both%20ITA,year%20return%20of%2013.3)). (PPA’s diversification and lighter Boeing weight likely helped it slightly outpace the more concentrated ITA during that volatile period.)  

**Other recent events:** During **Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in Feb 2022**, defense ETFs similarly jumped as Western governments ramped up military aid. ITA and PPA both rallied strongly in Q1 2022, providing a counterweight to falling markets. More recently, through 2024–2025, ongoing conflicts (Ukraine, Gaza) and rising defense budgets worldwide led to *sustained outperformance*. PPA, for example, delivered about 13.3% annualized over 10 years ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=PPA%20has%20outperformed%20both%20ITA,year%20return%20of%2013.3)) – a figure boosted by the past two years’ geopolitical tailwinds. According to a late-2025 analysis, **global defense ETFs saw large inflows in 2024–25** as investors used them “as a hedge against geopolitical instability” and to capitalize on surging military spending ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=Together%2C%20these%20developments%20have%20created,drive%20very%20different%20performance%20outcomes)). In short, these funds have tended to **spike on headline conflicts** and outperform during prolonged tensions, though the magnitude of gains can vary with each fund’s composition. (XAR’s equal-weight tilt toward smaller aerospace names can make it more volatile – it often leads in upswings, as seen in 2025, but could also lag if big contractors are the main beneficiaries.)  

## 4. “Pure-Play” Defense Exposure in Each ETF  
Despite all being labeled “Aerospace & Defense,” the **purity** of defense exposure differs:  

- **ITA:** Has the **lowest pure-defense concentration** because it is top-heavy in companies with large commercial businesses. Boeing and GE Aerospace alone made up ~30% of ITA in late 2025 ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=However%2C%20ITA%20is%20weighted%20by,largest%20holding%20at%20just%204.8)), yet Boeing and GE derive substantial revenue from commercial jets (passenger aircraft engines, etc.). RTX (16% of ITA) also has a mixed profile – after its United Tech merger, it includes Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, which serve civil aviation alongside defense. This means a significant chunk of ITA’s holdings are tied to commercial aerospace cycles rather than strictly defense. Only about half of ITA’s weight is in pure defense contractors (Lockheed, Northrop, L3Harris, etc.), with the rest in dual-use or civilian aerospace firms. In other words, ITA’s exposure to “true” defense is diluted by its big aerospace names.  

- **PPA:** Offers the **highest pure-defense exposure** among the three. Its index methodology explicitly *limits* exposure to firms where defense is just one segment ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=While%20the%20index%20has%20historical,at%20the%20Invesco%20provider%20site)). This has the effect of spreading weight more toward companies focused on defense and homeland security. PPA still holds Boeing, GE, RTX, etc., but caps their influence – preventing those diversified giants from dominating the fund ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=PPA%20uses%20a%20modified%20market,at%20the%20Invesco%20provider%20site)). Meanwhile, pure-play defense primes and contractors (LMT, NOC, GD, LHX, Huntington Ingalls, etc.) collectively carry substantial weight. PPA also includes some niche defense-tech names (e.g. possibly cybersecurity or military IT firms) and smaller contractors, which are mostly pure defense. The result is a more **balanced portfolio** where no single commercial-heavy OEM overwhelms it ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=PPA%20uses%20a%20modified%20market,at%20the%20Invesco%20provider%20site)). In practice, this means a greater percentage of PPA’s assets are tied to defense contracts and spending. (One hint: PPA’s performance has been very strong during defense budget upcycles ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=PPA%20has%20outperformed%20both%20ITA,year%20return%20of%2013.3)), implying its holdings are well-levered to defense trends.)  

- **XAR:** By equal-weighting, XAR gives *small and mid-cap aerospace suppliers* as much prominence as the big defense primes ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=,contractors%20from%20dominating%20the%20portfolio)) ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=XAR%20currently%20holds%2040%20companies%2C,aerospace%20segment%20than%20pure%20defense)). Many of those smaller companies are involved in the **aerospace segment (often commercial)** – for example, companies like ATI, Howmet, Woodward, and Carpenter Technology (all top 10 XAR holdings) primarily supply aircraft engines, components, and materials used in civilian and military planes alike ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/#:~:text=Name%20%20,3.65)). XAR certainly holds pure defense contractors too, but because of the equal weights, the pure-defense portion doesn’t dominate the fund’s makeup. In fact, State Street notes that XAR’s methodology *increases exposure to mid/small caps that “tend to be more concentrated in the aerospace segment than pure defense.”* ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=XAR%20currently%20holds%2040%20companies%2C,aerospace%20segment%20than%20pure%20defense)) So while XAR captures the broad sector, its **pure defense concentration** is moderate – probably higher than ITA’s (since Boeing is small in XAR) but lower than PPA’s. XAR is best thought of as a mix of defense primes **and** the broader aviation industry.  

In summary, **PPA has the most “pure defense” flavor** by weighting and design, closely followed by XAR (which spreads into more aerospace names). ITA has the least pure-defense focus, due to its heavy inclusion of commercial aerospace manufacturing. This distinction matters for an Iran war trade: a fund with more *true defense* exposure (weapons, missiles, military tech) would theoretically respond more directly to wartime spending, whereas one with more civil aviation exposure might see a tempered effect. PPA’s strategy to avoid overexposure to diversified industrials ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=PPA%20uses%20a%20modified%20market,at%20the%20Invesco%20provider%20site))makes it a strong candidate when an investor wants maximum defense bang-for-buck via an ETF.  

## 5. ETF vs. Individual Defense Stock Picks (Risk/Reward)  

For an Iran-war-driven trade, investors can choose a broad ETF, specific defense stocks, or a blend. Each approach has pros and cons:  

- **Defense ETF (ITA, PPA, or XAR):** An ETF provides **instant diversification** across the defense sector, reducing single-stock risk. This is useful given uncertainties in how a conflict unfolds – one company might hit an unexpected snag (a failed weapons test or contract issue) but the fund overall should still track the sector’s upward trend. An ETF is also simpler: one trade gives exposure to jets, missiles, shipbuilders, electronics, etc. The **trade-off is dilution** of potential gains. You’re buying the **average** of the basket, which in these cases includes some non-pure names (as discussed, Boeing or civil aerospace suppliers). In a hot war scenario, that means an ETF’s return might be a bit **muted by holdings that don’t fully benefit** (or that even suffer) during the conflict. For example, ITA’s heavy Boeing stake could cap its short-term upside ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Overall%2C%20this%20has%20been%20a,airplanes%20at%20Chicago%E2%80%99s%20O%E2%80%99Hare%20airport)) – if Boeing stock lags due to its commercial business, ITA won’t climb as much as a pure defense portfolio. Even the author of a comparative analysis ranked ITA behind the others partly because “its large position in Boeing could be a detriment” near-term ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=All%20three%20are%20good%20ETFs%2C,at%20this%20point%20in%20time)). Funds like PPA or XAR mitigate this by holding Boeing in smaller proportions, but they still contain smaller aerospace names that may not move in lockstep with defense news. **Bottom line:** ETFs offer a **safer, broader bet** on war-driven defense spending, with slightly lower upside than a concentrated bet. They also tend to be more liquid and easier to trade in and out of quickly, which could be useful in fast-moving geopolitical situations.  

- **Individual Defense Stocks (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, LHX, etc.):** Picking individual defense contractors can provide a **purer and potentially higher-upside play** on a war outbreak. For instance, if conflict with Iran intensifies, companies like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, or Raytheon (RTX) could see direct benefits (new missile defense orders, replenishment of munitions, etc.), and their stocks might jump significantly in anticipation. By holding these names directly, an investor gets **100% pure defense exposure** – there’s no Boeing or GE to dilute the gains. Moreover, the “Big 5” defense primes have enormous backlogs (over $700 B combined) and strong moats, meaning they stand to profit from sustained military buildups ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=contractors%2C%20which%20are%20the%20big,18%20Super%20Hornet%20and)) ([www.kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/etfs/best-aerospace-and-defense-etfs#:~:text=General%20Dynamics%20,much%20of%20modern%20militaries%27%20arsenals)). However, the **risks are higher**: individual stocks can be volatile and are subject to idiosyncratic setbacks. For example, an operational problem or a single contract loss can send a stock tumbling even if the sector is up. You also face **concentration risk** – a portfolio of only one or two defense names could underperform if those picks happen not to be the main beneficiaries of the specific conflict scenario. (E.g., a firm focused on Navy contracts might not spike as much in an air campaign, whereas an aerospace-focused firm would.) Valuations are another consideration: many defense stocks now trade at price/earnings multiples in the mid-20s up to ~40×, baking in a lot of optimism. If war outcomes disappoint or budgets fall short, these stocks could pull back. In summary, going with individual **high-conviction picks** amplifies both potential reward *and* risk. It’s akin to putting your money on the specific defense contractors you believe will gain most from an Iran conflict – and if you’re right, the payoff could beat any ETF. But if you’re wrong or unlucky, you don’t have the cushion of diversification.  

- **Blended Approach:** Many investors may choose a **combination** – for example, taking a core position in a defense ETF (for broad coverage) and supplementing it with a couple of individual stock positions to overweight favorites. This can strike a balance between diversification and conviction. The ETF holding forms a base that should capture the general trend (e.g. increased defense spending, rising sector tide), while the add-on stock picks allow you to **lean into specific themes** or companies. In an Iran war scenario, one might hold a defense ETF like PPA or XAR for overall exposure, and then add, say, Northrop Grumman (for its expertise in missiles and drones) or L3Harris (for communications and electronic warfare tech) to target particular wartime needs. The blended approach reduces the chance of badly underperforming the sector (because the ETF will broadly track it), yet if your chosen stocks outperform the average, you get an **extra kick** to the upside. The downside is some added complexity – you have to manage multiple positions – and you’re not as fully protected from single-stock events as you would be with only an ETF. It’s important in this approach to size positions thoughtfully (the ETF could be, for example, 50–70% of the total defense allocation, and the individual picks making up the rest, depending on confidence level). Essentially, this approach **diversifies your diversification** – it acknowledges that while the sector will likely rise in a war, some names will do better than others, and you position to benefit from that.  

In evaluating **risk/reward** for an Iran conflict trade: an ETF is lower-risk, lower-reward (a broad but somewhat diluted bet on rising defense fortunes), individual stocks are higher-risk, higher-reward (sharper exposure to the war thesis), and a mix can calibrate risk to one’s conviction. For example, a recent analysis favored **XAR or PPA over ITA** for broader exposure without Boeing’s drag ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=All%20three%20are%20good%20ETFs%2C,at%20this%20point%20in%20time)) – but an investor could go a step further and simply avoid Boeing entirely by buying select defense equities. Ultimately, if one is very confident that defense spending will skyrocket (and knows which firms will garner the biggest contracts), leaning into those stocks makes sense. If one is less sure or wants to limit downside if the conflict de-escalates, an ETF or ETF-plus-a-little-extra approach is prudent. It comes down to balancing “don’t miss out on the defense boom” against “don’t overbet on one or two names.”  

## 6. Key Data Points for Trade Cards (Entry, Target, Risks, Sizing)  

- **Current Entry Levels:** As of late February 2026, defense ETFs are trading near recent highs after their 2025 run-up. ITA is around **$235** per share ([www.ishares.com](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239502/ishares-us-aerospace-defense-etf#:~:text=,41)), PPA about **$174** ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/ppa/#:~:text=NYSEARCA%3A%20PPA%20%C2%B7%20Real,%C2%B7%20USD)), and XAR roughly **$270** ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/holdings/#:~:text=NYSEARCA%3A%20XAR%20%C2%B7%20Real,%C2%B7%20USD)). These prices reflect substantial gains over the past year (50%+ in some cases), but also a consolidation as the market assesses how far the defense cycle has to go. For individual stocks, prices vary: for instance, Lockheed Martin is trading in the ~$500–$550 range, Northrop Grumman around the mid-$400s, etc., with P/E ratios generally in the 20–30s. An investor considering a new position now should note that these are elevated levels historically, so timing and confirmation of the war thesis will be important.  

- **Target Price / Upside Potential:** Given the scenario of an Iran–US/Israel war, one could set **upside targets** of roughly +15–25% for the defense ETFs from current levels, and potentially higher for select stocks. Analysts’ consensus targets prior to the recent run were more conservative – for example, in early 2024 Wall Street’s average target for ITA implied only ~10.7% upside ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Turning%20to%20Wall%20Street%2C%20ITA,upside%20potential)). However, those forecasts have been blown out by actual events – PPA and XAR far exceeded a 10% move in the recent conflict-driven rally. For a war trade, one might project ITA to reach the mid-$260s, PPA to ~$200, and XAR to around $320+ (rough ballpark if another 15–20% uptick materializes). These assume that heightened defense spending and war sentiment add another leg to the 2025 gains. For individual stocks, upside could be more pronounced: e.g., stocks like Northrop or L3Harris might see 20–30% climbs from here if they land major contracts or if threat levels remain high (on top of the substantial backlog-fueled growth already in place). It’s worth noting that **recent performance has been stellar** – XAR’s nearly 59% return in the last year ([stockanalysis.com](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/xar/#:~:text=XAR%20had%20a%20total%20return,22)) – so any further upside will likely require genuinely escalating conflict or budget news to justify. As a result, **targets should be set with a war outcome in mind** (and perhaps a time horizon through the conflict’s expected duration). If a quick resolution arises instead, these targets may not be reached.  

- **Key Risk Factors:** Despite the bullish thesis on defense, several risks should be highlighted on the trade card. **Political/diplomatic risk:** If tensions with Iran de-escalate or a peace deal is reached unexpectedly, the “war trade” could unwind, sending defense stocks lower in the short term. **Budget risk:** Even with conflict, actual defense budget increases might lag expectations or get bogged down in politics, tempering the revenue outlook for contractors. **Valuation risk:** Defense equities now carry rich valuations (many in the upper-20s P/E, with some names even higher), so any sign of peaking earnings or reduced orders could trigger a pullback. **Execution risk:** Individual companies face execution issues – for example, Boeing’s ongoing production and quality problems have shown how even defense-related businesses can stumble ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ita-xar-ppa%3A-which-defense-etf-is-the-better-buy#:~:text=Overall%2C%20this%20has%20been%20a,airplanes%20at%20Chicago%E2%80%99s%20O%E2%80%99Hare%20airport)). For pure-play defense firms, risks include cost overruns on big programs, supply chain issues (a serious concern if war strains production of everything from semiconductors to rocket fuel), or even a change in administration (if U.S. leadership shifts and foreign policy pivots, defense spending could be curbed). Another risk factor: **broad market risk** – a major war can spook overall markets or economies (e.g. oil price spikes, recession fears), which could at least partially offset gains in defense stocks as part of a flight from risk assets. Finally, **timeline risk** should be mentioned: war trades can be very time-sensitive. If investors have already “priced in” a conflict, there’s a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news effect once fighting actually starts. Keeping an eye on how much enthusiasm is already baked into prices is crucial. Each of these risks (geopolitical, financial, operational) means that an Iran war trade, while attractive, is not without potential downside scenarios, and stop-loss or exit strategies should be considered.  

- **Position Sizing Suggestions:** For a diversified **ETF-based trade**, a moderate allocation is reasonable given reduced volatility – for example, dedicating *around 5–10%* of a portfolio to a defense ETF play. This size lets the trade materially contribute to returns if the thesis plays out, without overly concentrating the portfolio if things go wrong. If using **individual stocks**, position sizes might be smaller per stock (say 2–4% of the portfolio each) to manage single-name risk – especially if buying multiple defense names, one might cap the total exposure at ~10% across them or whatever fits risk tolerance. A **blended approach** might involve, for instance, a 5% position in PPA or XAR plus an additional 2% each in two favorite stocks like LMT and NOC. That would total ~9%, giving broad coverage with some tilt. Since this is a tactical trade on war outbreak, it’s also wise to **set clear entry and exit levels**: e.g., enter around current prices (noting the above entry levels), and consider taking profit when/if the ETF hits the target (e.g. ITA $260+) or if a de-escalation occurs. Position sizing should also factor in one’s existing exposure – if the portfolio already has defense or aerospace exposure, that counts toward the total risk. In short, **don’t “bet the farm” on any single outcome**. A war trade can be a meaningful but not dominant portion of the portfolio. The suggested sizing on the trade card would reflect this balanced approach, ensuring the investor can capture upside from a defense surge while staying within their risk comfort zone. (For example, a note could be: *“Position: 7% of portfolio in PPA (or mix of defense names); consider stop-loss at –10%, target +20%”* – tailoring to how aggressive the investor wants to be.)  

Each of these key points – entry price, upside target, risks, and size – will help construct a well-rounded trade thesis card. By clearly stating the **entry** (current price), the **target** (expected upside % or price in a war scenario), the **risks** (what could go wrong), and a **suggested position size**, the trade idea becomes concrete and actionable, while acknowledging uncertainty. All data and assumptions should be kept updated with the latest developments (for instance, if diplomatic talks start, one might revise that risk or trim the position). With sources and reasoning laid out, the trade cards will give a transparent roadmap for anyone assessing the “defense ETF vs stocks” question amid a potential Iran conflict.
