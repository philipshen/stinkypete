# Defense ETFs vs. Individual Stock Picks: Strategic Allocation for an Iran-US/Israel Conflict Scenario

## Executive Summary

This report evaluates the efficacy of utilizing Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) versus individual equity selection for a portfolio positioned to capitalize on a hypothetical kinetic escalation involving Iran, Israel, and the United States. The research draws upon market data as of February 2026, analyzing the composition, risk profile, and historical performance of three primary investment vehicles: iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA), and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR).

**Key Findings:**
*   **Commercial Drag is Significant:** The "Defense" ETF label is a misnomer for market-cap-weighted funds like ITA. Approximately 30-40% of the weighted exposure in ITA and PPA is tied to commercial aviation (e.g., GE Aerospace, Boeing Commercial), which historically underperforms during geopolitical crises due to rising oil prices and airspace closures.
*   **Boeing and GE Dominance:** GE Aerospace (heavily commercial) and Boeing constitute nearly 30% of ITA. Boeing’s mixed execution and heavy commercial reliance create a "drag" on pure defense theses.
*   **XAR as the Purest ETF Play:** Due to its equal-weight methodology, XAR minimizes the impact of mega-cap commercial aerospace firms and maximizes exposure to mid-cap defense pure-plays (e.g., Kratos, AeroVironment) that benefit directly from asymmetric warfare spending.
*   **Recommendation:** For a targeted Iran war trade, a **blended approach** is superior. We recommend a core position in individual prime contractors (LMT, NOC, RTX) to ensure 100% defense revenue capture, supplemented by XAR for broad industrial base exposure. ITA is recommended only for risk-averse investors seeking lower volatility at the expense of thesis purity.

## 1. ETF Composition Analysis

To determine the suitability of ETFs for a war-specific trade, we must dissect their internal structure. The divergence in weighting methodologies results in drastically different exposures to the specific drivers of a conflict trade (munitions, drones, missile defense) versus the detractors (commercial travel demand).

### 1.1 iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA)
ITA is the largest fund in the sector but suffers from extreme top-heavy concentration, making it functionally a proxy for three specific companies: GE Aerospace, RTX, and Boeing.

*   **Index Methodology:** Tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index. It uses a **market-cap-weighted** methodology, heavily skewing the portfolio toward the largest industrial giants [cite: 1].
*   **AUM:** ~$15.7 billion (as of Feb 2026) [cite: 2, 3].
*   **Expense Ratio:** 0.38% [cite: 1, 2].
*   **Total Holdings:** 43-45 [cite: 3, 4].

**Top 10 Holdings (as of Feb 2026) [cite: 3, 5]:**
| Rank | Holding | Ticker | Weight | Primary Exposure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | GE Aerospace | GE | 21.01% | Commercial Engines (75% revenue) |
| 2 | RTX Corporation | RTX | 15.49% | Diversified (Defense/Commercial) |
| 3 | The Boeing Company | BA | 7.65% | Commercial (60%) / Defense (40%) |
| 4 | Lockheed Martin | LMT | 5.18% | Pure Defense |
| 5 | Howmet Aerospace | HWM | 5.11% | Industrial/Parts |
| 6 | Northrop Grumman | NOC | 4.84% | Pure Defense |
| 7 | L3Harris Technologies| LHX | 4.70% | Defense Electronics |
| 8 | General Dynamics | GD | 3.87% | Defense (Marine/Land) |
| 9 | TransDigm Group | TDG | 3.81% | Aftermarket Parts (Mixed) |
| 10 | Axon Enterprise | AXON | 3.55% | Law Enforcement (Non-Military) |
| **Total**| **Top 10 Concentration** | | **~75.2%** | |

*Critique:* ITA is essentially a GE and RTX fund. With GE Aerospace comprising 21% of the fund and deriving ~75% of its revenue from commercial engines [cite: 6], ITA is highly correlated to global air travel demand, not just Pentagon spending.

### 1.2 Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA)
PPA offers a middle ground, utilizing a "systemically important" methodology that ensures inclusion of key defense firms but caps the massive conglomerates slightly more than ITA.

*   **Index Methodology:** Tracks the SPADE Defense Index. It uses a **modified market-capitalization** weighting with a focus on companies "systemically important" to defense and homeland security [cite: 7, 8].
*   **AUM:** ~$8.2 billion [cite: 9, 10].
*   **Expense Ratio:** 0.58% (Highest of the three) [cite: 8, 9].
*   **Total Holdings:** ~60-63 [cite: 10, 11].

**Top 10 Holdings (as of Feb 2026) [cite: 10, 11]:**
| Rank | Holding | Ticker | Weight | Primary Exposure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Lockheed Martin | LMT | ~9.00% | Pure Defense |
| 2 | GE Aerospace | GE | ~8.50% | Commercial Engines |
| 3 | The Boeing Company | BA | ~8.35% | Commercial/Defense |
| 4 | RTX Corporation | RTX | ~8.30% | Diversified |
| 5 | Northrop Grumman | NOC | ~6.05% | Pure Defense |
| 6 | General Dynamics | GD | ~4.73% | Defense |
| 7 | Howmet Aerospace | HWM | ~4.45% | Industrial |
| 8 | Honeywell Intl | HON | ~4.40% | Conglomerate (Mixed) |
| 9 | L3Harris Technologies| LHX | ~4.12% | Defense |
| 10 | Parker-Hannifin | PH | ~3.35% | Industrial (Mixed) |
| **Total**| **Top 10 Concentration** | | **~61%** | |

*Critique:* PPA provides better weighting to prime contractors (LMT is #1) compared to ITA. However, its high expense ratio (0.58%) and continued heavy exposure to Boeing and GE (combined ~17%) dilute the thesis.

### 1.3 SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR)
XAR represents the "Industrial Base" play. By equal-weighting, it suppresses the giants (Boeing, GE) and elevates the mid-tier suppliers and tech firms (AeroVironment, Kratos, Rocket Lab).

*   **Index Methodology:** Tracks the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index. It uses a **modified equal-weight** methodology [cite: 12, 13].
*   **AUM:** ~$6.1 billion [cite: 13, 14].
*   **Expense Ratio:** 0.35% (Lowest of the three) [cite: 12, 13].
*   **Total Holdings:** 40-42 [cite: 15, 16].

**Top 10 Holdings (as of Feb 2026) [cite: 5, 15]:**
*Note: Due to equal weighting, these percentages shift rapidly with price action.*
| Rank | Holding | Ticker | Weight | Primary Exposure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | ATI Inc. | ATI | 4.44% | Materials (Defense/Aero) |
| 2 | Karman Holdings | KRMN | ~4.2% | Specialized Manufacturing |
| 3 | Lockheed Martin | LMT | ~3.9% | Pure Defense |
| 4 | Huntington Ingalls | HII | ~3.9% | Naval Shipbuilding |
| 5 | Howmet Aerospace | HWM | 3.85% | Industrial |
| 6 | Woodward Inc. | WWD | 3.80% | Control Systems |
| 7 | Rocket Lab | RKLB | ~3.5% | Space/Defense |
| 8 | Curtiss-Wright | CW | ~3.3% | Naval/Nuclear |
| 9 | Textron | TXT | 3.30% | Helicopters/Aviation |
| 10 | The Boeing Company | BA | **3.28%** | Commercial/Defense |
| **Total**| **Top 10 Concentration** | | **~38%** | |

*Critique:* XAR has the lowest concentration risk and the lowest Boeing exposure (~3.3%). It provides significant exposure to smaller, high-beta defense names that often outperform during modernization cycles.

## 2. The Boeing Drag Problem

In the context of an Iran-US/Israel war, the "Boeing Drag" is a critical vulnerability for ETF investors. The thesis for the drag rests on the bifurcation of Boeing’s revenue stream: Defense (BDS) benefits from war, but Commercial Airplanes (BCA) suffers from geopolitical instability.

### 2.1 Quantitative Weighting Analysis
*   **ITA:** Boeing is the **3rd largest holding** at ~7.65% to 8.2% [cite: 3, 5].
*   **PPA:** Boeing is the **3rd largest holding** at ~8.35% to 9.0% [cite: 11, 17].
*   **XAR:** Boeing is a **mid-tier holding** at ~3.28% to 3.66% [cite: 15, 18].

**Quantified Drag Risk:**
An investor putting $10,000 into PPA or ITA is effectively buying ~$800-$900 of Boeing stock. In contrast, an XAR investor holds only ~$330 of Boeing.

### 2.2 Thesis Dilution: Commercial vs. Defense Revenue
As of year-end 2025 financial reporting:
*   **Boeing Defense (BDS):** 2025 Revenue was **$27.2 billion**, roughly **30.4%** of total revenue ($89.5B). While BDS grew 14% and secured contracts like the F-15IA for Israel, it operated at a loss or near break-even for much of 2024-2025 due to fixed-price contract overruns (KC-46 tanker) [cite: 19, 20].
*   **Boeing Commercial (BCA):** 2025 Revenue was **$41.5 billion**, roughly **46.4%** of total revenue. This segment is highly sensitive to global air travel [cite: 19].

**The War Impact Mechanism:**
1.  **Oil Price Shock:** A conflict involving Iran typically spikes oil prices. Airlines, facing higher fuel costs, delay aircraft orders or deliveries.
2.  **Airspace Closures:** War in the Middle East disrupts key transit routes (Europe-Asia), reducing flight hours and aftermarket service revenue (Global Services).
3.  **Supply Chain:** Titanium and specialized materials often face constriction during war, delaying commercial production lines.

**Conclusion on Drag:**
Boeing's commercial exposure (~46% of revenue) significantly outweighs its defense upside (~30% of revenue) in the short term. Furthermore, Boeing's operational difficulties (quality control, strikes in 2024/25) make it a high-beta risk unrelated to the war thesis. ITA and PPA carry a "hidden" drag where nearly 10% of capital is tied to a company that may *lose* value if global travel contracts, regardless of F-15 orders.

## 3. Performance Analysis: War & YTD 2026

Analyzing price action during specific geopolitical trigger events reveals how these funds react to kinetic warfare.

### 3.1 Recent Performance: YTD 2026 (As of Feb 27, 2026)
Following a projected increase in US defense budgets to $1 trillion and heightened global tensions in early 2026:

*   **XAR (SPDR):** **+15.4% to +17.3%** YTD. XAR has shown the strongest momentum, driven by mid-cap volatility and takeover speculation in the industrial base [cite: 21, 22].
*   **PPA (Invesco):** **+14.4% to +15.6%** YTD. Outperformed ITA due to higher weighting in prime contractors like LMT relative to ITA's GE concentration [cite: 23, 24].
*   **ITA (iShares):** **+12.4% to +13.5%** YTD. Lagged peers. While GE Aerospace performed well, the heavy commercial weighting dampened the "war premium" relative to pure-play defense stocks [cite: 24, 25].

### 3.2 Historical Case Study: October 2023 (Hamas-Israel Outbreak)
On the trading day immediately following the October 7, 2023 attacks (Oct 9, 2023), the market reaction clearly favored the sector, but with distinctions:

*   **ITA:** +4.5% single-day gain [cite: 26, 27].
*   **XAR:** +4.2% single-day gain [cite: 26, 27].
*   **PPA:** +4.1% single-day gain [cite: 26, 27].
*   **Context:** While ITA jumped initially, the subsequent months saw volatility. Notably, the individual stock **LMT** jumped significantly more (often 8-10% in such crises) than the ETFs, proving the dilution effect of the ETF wrapper [cite: 26, 27].

## 4. Pure-Play Defense Exposure Analysis

This section quantifies the "Purity" of the defense thesis. We classify "Pure Defense" as revenue derived from munitions, weapons platforms, military aircraft, and government intelligence/space contracting. "Commercial" includes civilian aircraft engines, airliners, and industrial HVAC/building systems (Honeywell).

### 4.1 Estimated Revenue Purity by ETF
*Calculated based on weighted average revenue segmentation of top holdings.*

1.  **XAR (Highest Defense Purity):**
    *   **Purity Score:** **~65-70%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Equal weighting amplifies pure-play mid-caps like Kratos (KTOS), AeroVironment (AVAV), and Huntington Ingalls (HII). While it holds Boeing and Spirit, they are diluted to <4% each. The "Industrial Base" contains many suppliers who pivot between commercial and defense, but the *sensitivity* to defense budgets is highest here.
    *   *Note:* Sources indicate XAR is preferred for "unconcentrated industry exposure" and better captures smaller defense firms [cite: 12, 13].

2.  **PPA (Moderate Purity):**
    *   **Purity Score:** **~55-60%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** Heavy LMT and NOC weightings help (pure defense), but Honeywell (HON) and GE Aerospace (GE) drag the score down. Honeywell is largely an industrial conglomerate; GE is 75% commercial.

3.  **ITA (Lowest Defense Purity):**
    *   **Purity Score:** **~45-50%**.
    *   **Reasoning:** ITA is structurally broken as a pure war trade. With **21% in GE Aerospace** (75% commercial) and **8% in Boeing** (mixed), nearly 30% of the fund is explicitly tied to the health of commercial airlines. If an Iran war causes oil to hit $120/barrel, airline profitability collapses, dragging down GE and Boeing, and suppressing ITA's defense gains [cite: 6, 28].

## 5. ETF vs. Individual Picks: The Risk/Reward Matrix

For an **Iran-US/Israel war scenario**, the risk profile differs significantly from a general long-term investment. The trade assumes a sharp spike in munition consumption, missile defense activation, and potential naval engagement.

### 5.1 Option A: Buying Defense ETFs (ITA/PPA/XAR)
*   **Pros:** Mitigation of single-stock execution risk (e.g., a factory fire or DOJ investigation at one company). Liquid and easy to size.
*   **Cons:** **Thesis Dilution.** You are effectively hedging your war bet with a commercial airline bet. In a high-intensity conflict, commercial aviation often sells off, neutralizing the defense gains in the ETF.
*   **Best For:** XAR is the best ETF choice here because it captures the *supply chain* surge (ammo, parts) without the heavy anchor of GE/Boeing.

### 5.2 Option B: Individual Stock Picks (LMT, RTX, NOC, GD, LHX)
*   **Pros:** **100% Thesis Capture.**
    *   **LMT/RTX:** Direct beneficiaries of missile defense (Iron Dome, Patriot, THAAD) which are critical in an Iran/Israel exchange.
    *   **NOC/GD:** Beneficiaries of strategic deterrence and munitions.
*   **Cons:** Concentration risk. Regulatory caps on profits.
*   **Verdict:** Historically, LMT and RTX outperform ETFs in the first 30 days of conflict because they are the "first call" for resupply.

### 5.3 The Blended Approach (Recommended)
Constructing a "Synthetic ETF" yields the highest risk-adjusted return for this specific thesis.
*   **Strategy:** Allocate 60% to a basket of LMT, RTX, and NOC (High conviction, missile/air defense focus). Allocate 40% to XAR (Broad exposure to the drone/supply chain mid-caps that are harder to pick individually).
*   **Why:** This eliminates the GE/Boeing drag while capturing both the Prime Contractor stability and the Mid-Cap growth explosion.

## 6. Trade Cards Data (Simulated for Feb 2026)

The following data points are derived from the 2026 context provided in the research material, suitable for the interactive trade cards.

### Trade Card 1: The Broad Industrial Play (ETF)
*   **Ticker:** **XAR** (SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF)
*   **Entry Zone:** $278 - $282 [cite: 29, 30].
*   **Target Price (12mo):** $320 - $326 (Implies ~15-20% upside) [cite: 31, 32].
*   **Stop Loss:** $258 (Below recent support).
*   **Thesis:** Equal-weight structure captures the high-beta upside of mid-cap defense suppliers (drones, space) without the drag of Boeing’s commercial struggles. Best ETF proxy for a "total industrial mobilization."
*   **Risk Factors:** High volatility (Beta > 1.0); exposure to small-cap suppliers vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.

### Trade Card 2: The "Prime" Hedge (ETF)
*   **Ticker:** **PPA** (Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF)
*   **Entry Zone:** $178 - $181 [cite: 10, 33].
*   **Target Price (12mo):** $210 (Implies ~15% upside) [cite: 34].
*   **Stop Loss:** $168.
*   **Thesis:** The "Safe Haven" play. overweight Lockheed and Northrop compared to XAR, but underweight GE/Boeing compared to ITA. Use this if the goal is lower volatility exposure to the major contractors.
*   **Risk Factors:** Expense ratio (0.58%) eats into returns; still carries ~17% commercial/mixed exposure.

### Trade Card 3: The "Avoid" Signal
*   **Ticker:** **ITA** (iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF)
*   **Current Price:** ~$241 [cite: 35].
*   **Analysis:** **NOT RECOMMENDED** for this specific trade thesis.
*   **Reasoning:** With ~21% allocated to GE Aerospace (commercial engines), this ETF is positively correlated with healthy global air travel. An Iran-Israel war poses a direct threat to global aviation fuel costs and routing, making ITA a structurally flawed vehicle for a pure war hedge.

### Summary Table for Trade Sizing
| Asset | Role in Portfolio | Suggested Allocation | Key Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LMT/RTX** | Alpha Generators | 50% | Immediate Missile Defense Demand |
| **XAR** | Beta / Supply Chain | 30% | Industrial Base Mobilization |
| **Cash/Hedges**| Dry Powder | 20% | Volatility Management |
