TOPIC: Energy Stock EPS Sensitivity to Oil Prices

CONTEXT: This research is part of a larger investigation into stock trade ideas based on an Iran-US/Israel war outbreak. The final output is an interactive static HTML site with trade cards featuring risk/reward charts. We need concrete EPS sensitivity numbers to calibrate the risk/reward visualizations for energy sector trade cards.

SPECIFIC DATA NEEDED:
For each of these tickers: XOM, CVX, COP, HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI, KMI, EPD, ET

1. **EPS sensitivity to oil prices**: What is the approximate EPS uplift (in dollars) per $10/bbl increase in Brent crude oil price? Include the methodology behind these estimates (e.g., company guidance, sell-side models, historical regression).

2. **Current consensus EPS estimates**: FY2025 and FY2026 consensus EPS estimates from Wall Street analysts.

3. **Current consensus price targets**: Mean and range (low/high) of analyst price targets.

4. **Revenue/earnings mix**: What percentage of each company's revenue/earnings is directly tied to crude oil prices vs. natural gas, refining margins, midstream fees, etc.? This helps understand why some tickers are more oil-sensitive than others.

5. **Historical validation**: During the 2022 oil spike ($120+/bbl Brent), what actually happened to these companies' EPS? How did actual results compare to the sensitivities implied by sell-side models?

For the midstream names (KMI, EPD, ET), explain why their EPS sensitivity to oil differs from E&P names and what volume/throughput metrics matter more.

For oilfield services (HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI), explain the lag between oil price spikes and their earnings impact, and what drives their EPS (rig counts, capex budgets, etc.).
