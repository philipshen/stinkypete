# Energy Stocks’ EPS Sensitivity to Oil Prices

## Overview and Context  
Energy companies’ earnings are highly influenced by commodity prices, but the degree of sensitivity varies widely by business model. Below we analyze ten key energy stocks – **ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), ConocoPhillips (COP), Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BKR), TechnipFMC (FTI), Kinder Morgan (KMI), Enterprise Products Partners (EPD),** and **Energy Transfer (ET)** – focusing on: 

- **EPS sensitivity to oil price changes:** How much each company’s earnings per share (EPS) might increase for a $10 per barrel rise in crude (Brent) price, and the basis for these estimates (company disclosures, analyst models, or historical trends).  
- **Consensus EPS forecasts:** Wall Street analysts’ current consensus EPS estimates for FY2025 and FY2026.  
- **Analyst price targets:** The average (mean) analyst 12-month price target for each stock, along with the lowest and highest targets, to gauge market sentiment and expected valuation.  
- **Revenue/Earnings mix:** The composition of each company’s business – what percent of revenue or profit comes from oil production versus natural gas, refining, midstream pipeline fees, oilfield services, etc. This mix explains differences in oil-price sensitivity.  
- **Historical validation (2022 spike):** How these companies’ EPS actually responded during the 2022 oil price spike (when Brent exceeded $120). We compare the real-world EPS outcomes to what would be expected from the sensitivity models, noting any surprises (e.g. effects of refining margins or lags in oilfield activity). 

We also address why **midstream pipeline operators** (KMI, EPD, ET) have much lower direct oil sensitivity (focusing more on volumes/throughput), and why **oilfield service providers** (HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI) experience a lagged impact from oil spikes (driven by rig counts and capital spending cycles). All claims are supported with data and sources.

## Upstream & Integrated Majors: XOM, CVX, COP  
These firms derive a large share of earnings from producing oil and gas (upstream), though XOM and CVX also have significant downstream refining and chemical operations. They benefit directly from higher oil prices, but integrated models can moderate pure price sensitivity (since refining margins sometimes move opposite to crude prices). Below we detail each:

**ExxonMobil (XOM):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Exxon’s own disclosures imply roughly **$0.5 – $0.8 incremental EPS per $10/bbl** change in oil prices, after-tax. For example, in late 2025 Exxon indicated a ~$300 million quarterly earnings increase from higher oil prices ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-xom-expects-oil-prices-refining-margins-impact-q3-earnings#:~:text=In%20its%20latest%208,the%20change%20in%20oil%20prices)) – equivalent to about $0.07 per share for a few-dollar move in crude, which scales to ~$0.50+ per share for a $10 full-year price change. Another approach is using production: Exxon produces ~2 million barrels of liquids per day, so a $10 increase yields ~$7.3 billion extra revenue per year; after ~40% tax that’s ~$4.4B (about $1.1 per share). However, higher oil can be partly offset by lower refining margins. **Netting these factors, a reasonable estimate is ~+$0.75 EPS for each $10 rise in Brent**. Actual history supports this range – Exxon’s EPS jumped from $5.39 in 2021 to $13.26 in 2022 when oil surged (a ~$7.87 increase with ~$30+ jump in oil) ([corporate.exxonmobil.com](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/0131_exxonmobil-announces-full-year-2022-results#:~:text=4Q22%20%20,Identified%20Items%20Per)), which is roughly $0.8–$1.0 per $10.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** Analysts expect **2025 EPS around $7.0** and **2026 around $7.0–$7.5**. Current consensus sees EPS dipping in 2025 versus recent years due to lower oil/gas assumptions, then stabilizing. (For reference, 2024 EPS was ~$7.79 and is projected to fall to $6.99 in 2025 ([www.chartmill.com](https://www.chartmill.com/stock/quote/XOM/earnings-estimates#:~:text=EPS%20YoY%20,18.17%25%20%20%7C%206.99)).)  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **$140.6**; High $171; Low $111 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/XOM/#:~:text=Exxon%20Mobil%20in%20the%20last,88)). The mean target implies modest downside from the recent ~$155 stock price, reflecting a Hold consensus. Targets span a wide range ($111 to $171) indicating different oil price views.  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** In 2022’s high-price environment, **upstream dominated Exxon’s earnings**. Out of $55.7B net income ([corporate.exxonmobil.com](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/0131_exxonmobil-announces-full-year-2022-results#:~:text=ExxonMobil%20announces%20full)), the upstream segment contributed the majority (on the order of ~$40B, about 70–75% of total profits), while refining (“Energy Products”) and chemicals provided the rest. For example, in 4Q 2022 upstream earned $8.2B versus $3.2B for refining ([corporate.exxonmobil.com](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/0131_exxonmobil-announces-full-year-2022-results#:~:text=%2A%20Upstream%20fourth,Positive%20unsettled%20derivatives%20mark)). This means Exxon’s earnings are heavily tied to crude and gas production. Natural gas is also significant – in 3Q 2025, Exxon noted $200 million quarterly profit uplift from gas price changes ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-xom-expects-oil-prices-refining-margins-impact-q3-earnings#:~:text=XOM%20added%20that%20it%20is,in%20the%20range%20of%20a)). Downstream and chemical operations can counterbalance oil price swings (margins often improve when crude falls and vice versa). Overall, **the majority of Exxon’s earnings track oil and gas prices**, albeit tempered by its integrated businesses.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Exxon’s results **far exceeded expectations** during the 2022 oil spike. EPS for 2022 reached $13.26 ([corporate.exxonmobil.com](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/0131_exxonmobil-announces-full-year-2022-results#:~:text=IRVING%2C%20Texas%20%E2%80%93%20January%2031%2C,taxes%20on%20the%20energy%20sector)) (up 146% year-over-year), whereas in early 2022 many analysts forecast around $9–$10 EPS at $100 oil. The beat was due in part to record refining profits and strong volumes. In other words, actual earnings growth outpaced a linear oil-price sensitivity model because refining margins surged simultaneously (tight product markets). Exxon’s upstream sensitivity roughly matched expectations (15% higher crude realizations in Q4 2022 vs Q3 cut upstream earnings by $4.2B sequentially) ([corporate.exxonmobil.com](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/0131_exxonmobil-announces-full-year-2022-results#:~:text=%2A%20Upstream%20fourth,Positive%20unsettled%20derivatives%20mark)), but the **company captured additional upside from downstream**. This illustrates that integrated majors can earn **more than expected in high-price scenarios** (and conversely, hold up better when oil falls, as downstream then cushions the blow).

**Chevron (CVX):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Chevron’s sensitivity is slightly higher per $10 oil increase, owing to its smaller share count and upstream focus. We estimate roughly **+$1.0 to $1.3 EPS per +$10/bbl**. Chevron produces ~1.7 million barrels of oil per day; a $10 uplift adds roughly $6–$7 billion pre-tax annually, or ~$4B after tax – spread over ~1.9B shares that’s about $2.00 per $10. However, some production is under profit-sharing contracts that dampen high-price gains, and like Exxon, its refining results can move inversely. Empirically, Chevron’s EPS jumped from **$8.14 in 2021 to $18.28 in 2022** ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVX/chevron/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted/1000#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%248.14)) when Brent rose ~$30-$40 – about $10 EPS increase, which is ~$2.5 per $10. This overshoot included exceptionally strong refining margins. A more “normal” rule of thumb from analysts is closer to **$1 per $10** for planning, recognizing integration.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$6.6–$6.7; 2026: ~$7.5** (approximate). Chevron’s consensus sees earnings bottoming in 2025 (oil price assumptions in the $60s) then recovering. For context, EPS is projected to fall from $9.72 in 2024 to around $6.63 in 2025 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVX/chevron/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%2418.28%202021)) – in line with lower commodity forecasts – then improve.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **$176.4**; High $212; Low $124 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/CVX/#:~:text=Chevron%20in%20the%20last%203,07)). The average target is around Chevron’s current price (~$180), with a mix of Buy/Hold ratings. The spread from $124 to $212 reflects varying oil outlooks; the consensus rating is Hold ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/CVX/#:~:text=Analyst%20Price%20Target%20is%20)).  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** **Upstream oil and gas production typically accounts for ~80%+ of Chevron’s earnings**, especially in boom times. In the first 9 months of 2022, for example, Chevron’s upstream earned $24.8B vs $6.4B for downstream ([chevroncorp.gcs-web.com](https://chevroncorp.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chevron-announces-third-quarter-2022-results#:~:text=,)) – upstream was ~80% of segment earnings. Thus crude oil (and to a lesser extent natural gas) prices drive the bulk of Chevron’s profits. The company’s production mix is roughly 61% liquids, 39% gas; oil price changes tend to have a larger impact than gas (though global LNG prices also matter). Downstream refining contributed around 20% of earnings in 2022 ([chevroncorp.gcs-web.com](https://chevroncorp.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chevron-announces-third-quarter-2022-results#:~:text=,)), which helped during extreme oil moves – e.g. in 2022 refining profits also rose with high demand, augmenting total earnings. In weaker oil scenarios, refining margins often strengthen (for instance, Chevron noted it remains profitable even at $50 oil due to its integrated model ([uk.investing.com](https://uk.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-chevron-q1-2025-results-beat-eps-forecasts-93CH-4063297#:~:text=Earnings%20call%20transcript%3A%20Chevron%20Q1,whether%20you%20want%20to%20call))). Overall, **Chevron is highly oil-levered, but slightly less so than a pure producer due to its refining segment**.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Chevron’s actual results underscore high oil leverage. **2022 EPS was $18.28, up 125% from 2021 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVX/chevron/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted/1000#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%248.14)), far above consensus.** Upstream profits exploded with $100+ Brent, and refining also had robust margins. The ~$10.1 jump in EPS from 2021–22 equated to roughly $3.3 per $10 increase in Brent – higher than linear forecasts, as refining and LNG businesses also benefited. By 2023, as oil fell back to ~$80s, EPS dropped to $11.36 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVX/chevron/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%2418.28%202021)) (a 38% decline) – roughly consistent with sensitivity models, plus some catch-up maintenance in refining. In summary, **Chevron’s earnings overshot model predictions in the 2022 spike** due to synergistic high refining margins, demonstrating that integrated majors can significantly outperform basic oil-price sensitivities when commodity shocks hit multiple parts of the value chain.

**ConocoPhillips (COP):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** ConocoPhillips is a **pure upstream** producer (no refining or midstream distractions), making it one of the most oil-price-sensitive of this group. Based on historical data and company disclosures, COP’s sensitivity is approximately **+$2.0 to $3.0 EPS per $10/bbl**. In 2022, COP had ~1.7 million barrels/day of hydrocarbon production and no hedges, so higher prices flowed directly to the bottom line. We can quantify this: COP’s adjusted EPS soared from **$6.01 in 2021 to $13.52 in 2022 ([www.conocophillips.com](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/conocophillips-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2022-results-and-176-preliminary-reserve-replacement-ratio-announces-2023-guidance-and-planned-return-of-capital-of-11-billion-declares-quarterly-dividend-and-variable-return-of-cash-distribution/#:~:text=Full,01%20per%20share))**, a $7.51 jump when Brent rose ~$30 (implying ~$2.5 EPS per +$10, excluding volume growth). Similarly, from 2022 to 2023, Brent fell and COP’s EPS fell in proportion. The company has even noted that every $1 change in oil price impacts their cash flow by roughly ~$120–$130 million, which translates to about $0.10–$0.12 per share for each $1 (i.e. ~$1.0–$1.2 per $10) – but that likely assumes constant volumes and ignores gas. Considering both oil and natural gas (which makes up ~35–40% of COP’s output), **a $10 increase in Brent (with similar % move in gas) could boost COP’s annual EPS by roughly $2–$3**. This high leverage reflects COP’s focused E&P model.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$8.50; 2026: ~$9.00 (estimate).** As a pure producer, COP’s consensus EPS moves with commodity strip pricing. After a record ~$8 EPS in 2023, analysts see COP earning in the mid-$6 per share range in 2024 and rebounding to the $8–$9 range in 2025–26 (assuming oil recovery). For example, COP’s 2025 EPS might be in the high $8s if oil is ~$80. (Note: COP’s actual 2025 EPS was ~$6.16 due to the oil downturn that year ([www.conocophillips.com](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/conocophillips-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-announces-2026-guidance-and-quarterly-dividend/#:~:text=Full,79%20per%20share)); forward estimates will adjust if prices change.)  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **$115.00**; High $133; Low $98 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/COP/#:~:text=ConocoPhillips%20in%20the%20last%203,05)). The consensus target implies a slight upside (~4.5%) from current prices around $110. Wall Street is bullish overall (consensus **Buy** rating), reflecting confidence in COP’s leverage to any oil upturn. The target range ($98–$133) shows relatively tighter agreement on valuation compared to the majors (still wide, but COP’s outlook is almost purely a call on oil/gas prices and management returns).  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** **Nearly 100% of COP’s revenue and earnings are tied to upstream oil and natural gas production.** Unlike the integrated majors, ConocoPhillips has no downstream segment – it lives and dies by commodity prices. Within its production, oil (including NGLs) contributes roughly two-thirds of revenue, and natural gas ~one-third (this mix can shift with price dynamics – in 2022 high oil made it ~70% oil). This means COP’s earnings sensitivity is divided between crude and gas. The company’s global portfolio (Lower 48 shale, Alaska, LNG, etc.) gives it exposure to both Brent and Henry Hub (and international gas benchmarks). Importantly, **there are no significant fixed-fee streams to buffer price swings** – operational discipline and hedging (which COP largely avoids, preferring price exposure) are the only tools. In 2022’s boom, this meant record profits: adjusted earnings of $17.3B ($13.52/share) ([www.conocophillips.com](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/conocophillips-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2022-results-and-176-preliminary-reserve-replacement-ratio-announces-2023-guidance-and-planned-return-of-capital-of-11-billion-declares-quarterly-dividend-and-variable-return-of-cash-distribution/#:~:text=Full,01%20per%20share)). In weaker price environments, COP’s profits shrink substantially (it remained profitable in 2020’s bust only by cutting costs). In summary, **COP’s earnings are directly and proportionally tied to commodity prices**, with oil price being the single biggest swing factor, moderated only by its sizable natural gas business and global project portfolio.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** ConocoPhillips exemplified the upside of oil leverage in 2022. **Adjusted EPS hit $13.52 ([www.conocophillips.com](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/conocophillips-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2022-results-and-176-preliminary-reserve-replacement-ratio-announces-2023-guidance-and-planned-return-of-capital-of-11-billion-declares-quarterly-dividend-and-variable-return-of-cash-distribution/#:~:text=Full,01%20per%20share)), more than double 2021’s $6.01**, driven purely by higher price realization and some production growth. Sell-side models that suggested on the order of +$2.5 EPS per $10 proved accurate – COP’s ~$7.5 EPS increase corresponded well to the ~$30 jump in Brent (i.e. about $2.5 per $10). In fact, COP’s results slightly **exceeded expectations** due to operational outperformance and no hedging to cap upside. By contrast, when prices fell in 2023–2025, COP’s EPS fell sharply (e.g. $7.79 in 2024 down to $6.16 in 2025) ([www.conocophillips.com](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/conocophillips-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results-announces-2026-guidance-and-quarterly-dividend/#:~:text=Full,79%20per%20share)), again roughly in line with price-driven forecasts. This volatility confirms COP’s model: **the company delivered the full benefit of the 2022 spike to shareholders, validating the high sensitivity estimates**, but also saw earnings decline commensurately when prices normalized. The key takeaway is that COP’s actual EPS moves very closely with oil (and gas) according to the “$2–3 EPS per $10” rule, with little deviation, since there were no downstream offsets or delays – a fact that was clearly demonstrated in 2022’s windfall and its aftermath.

*(The integrated majors and COP collectively demonstrate that upstream-heavy firms enjoyed enormous EPS gains in 2022’s $100+ oil environment – often even higher than linear sensitivities would suggest, thanks to concurrent gas and refining strength. Conversely, their 2025 consensus EPS are much lower, reflecting $60–$70 oil assumptions, illustrating the downside of that sensitivity.)*

## Oilfield Services & Equipment: HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI  
These companies do not produce oil themselves but sell services and technology to E&P operators. Thus, **their earnings depend on oil price indirectly**, via customers’ drilling and capital spending. There is typically a **lag**: when oil spikes, producers initially enjoy higher cash flows, then over subsequent quarters they boost drilling budgets and projects – which then drives up demand (and pricing power) for services. Likewise, when oil prices drop, E&P companies curtail new drilling after a delay, leading to a downturn in service activity. We examine each firm:

**Halliburton (HAL):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Halliburton’s financial results correlate with upstream activity levels, especially in North America. Rather than a simple $X per $10 oil, the relationship is via rig count and spending. Historically, a sustained $10 rise in oil (if maintained) can lead to **double-digit percentage increases in rig count and fracking demand over ~6–12 months**, translating to substantial EPS growth for HAL. For instance, the US oil rig count climbed from ~400 in early 2021 to ~600+ in late 2022 as oil rallied, contributing to Halliburton’s EPS rising from **$1.63 in 2021 to $2.92 in 2023 (a 69% jump) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022))**. We can say qualitatively that **Halliburton’s earnings might increase on the order of 15–20% for each $10 sustained oil price uplift**, once contracts re-price – though exact figures vary. In numerical terms, HAL earned about $0.24–$0.30 EPS per quarter at $50 oil, but around $0.70+ per quarter at $100 oil ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=2022,31%20%20%7C%20%240.29)) ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Halliburton%20Company%20reported%20a%20net,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). This suggests **EPS can roughly double when oil doubles**, rather than a fixed incremental dollar amount. The sensitivity isn’t linear and has a time lag: pricing for services improves only when capacity tightens. During the 2022 boom, Halliburton was able to raise service prices and utilization, significantly boosting margins by 2023. In summary, **Halliburton has a high beta to oil**, but realized over a few quarters – a $10 jump that persists can ultimately elevate its annual EPS by ~$0.5 to $0.7 (given enough time for drilling activity to respond).  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** After a cyclical peak, consensus expects moderation. **2025 EPS is projected around $1.50–$1.60; 2026 around $1.70–$1.80.** (For reference, HAL’s TTM EPS in 2025 has fallen to ~$1.51 ([companiesmarketcap.com](https://companiesmarketcap.com/halliburton/eps/#:~:text=Halliburton%20%28HAL%29%20,83%20a%20decrease%20over%20its)) as the 2022–23 upcycle cooled, and analysts anticipate a modest re-acceleration by 2026 if oil stabilizes higher.) These estimates are down from the 2023 actual ~$2.92, reflecting the current dip in North American activity. They could be upgraded if oil prices rise again and drilling picks up.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **$34.95**; High $40; Low $26 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/HAL/#:~:text=Halliburton%20in%20the%20last%203,01)). The mean target is essentially flat vs the recent ~$35 stock price, suggesting the market believes the stock already prices in a mid-cycle outlook. The range ($26–$40) implies differing views on whether another upcycle is near (bulls at $40) or activity will languish (bears near $26). The consensus rating is generally **Buy** (reflecting optimism about a multi-year industry uptrend despite near-term weakness).  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** Halliburton gets virtually all its revenue from oilfield services – primarily well completions (hydraulic fracturing, etc.) and drilling services. **Geographically**, about 50% of revenue comes from North America (shale basins) and 50% international. **Product-wise**, Halliburton reports two divisions: Completion & Production, and Drilling & Evaluation. Both depend on upstream capex. None of Halliburton’s revenue is directly tied to oil price contracts, but rather to the volume of work and service pricing. During high oil-price periods, exploration and production companies run more rigs and wells (driving volume) and service rates increase due to tight capacity – boosting Halliburton’s margins. For example, in Q1 2025 Halliburton’s North America revenue fell sharply as E&Ps cut back, causing net income to drop ~66% year-over-year ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Halliburton%20Company%20reported%20a%20net,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). Conversely, in 2022 as oil climbed over $100, Halliburton’s NA revenues and margins surged. This demonstrates that **Halliburton’s earnings are tied to oil indirectly via the capital spending cycle**: more drilling = more revenue. It has **no stable fee-based segment** – everything is exposed to industry cycles.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Halliburton benefited strongly but **with a lag**. In 2022, as oil spiked, HAL’s full-year EPS was still only $1.73 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=match%20at%20L27%202022%20,1.29)) – up modestly from $1.63 in 2021 – because the surge in activity was still ramping up mid-year (notably, Q2 2022 EPS was only $0.12 amid lingering supply chain/labor constraints ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=match%20at%20L53%202022,31%20%20%7C%20%240.29))). By 2023, however, the impact was in full swing: Halliburton’s 2023 EPS jumped to $2.92 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)) – a ~69% increase over 2022 – thanks to the prior year’s oil spike translating into higher rig counts and service pricing. This **overshot many sell-side expectations**, as companies maintained capital discipline a bit less than feared and supply tightness allowed service price increases. Notably, actual results in 2023 showed Halliburton’s operating income nearly doubled year-over-year in some quarters ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20for%20the%20quarter,987%20million%20a%20year%20ago)). However, as oil prices and North American gas prices fell in late 2023, U.S. drilling contracted and Halliburton’s earnings declined again in early 2025 (Q1 2025 EPS down to $0.24 from $0.68 in Q1 2024) ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Halliburton%20Company%20reported%20a%20net,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). This validates the expected lagged pattern: **Halliburton’s EPS peaked roughly 6–12 months after the oil price peak**, consistent with the typical cycle. The upshot is that **sell-side models calling for a services boom in 2023 were largely confirmed** – HAL’s EPS even slightly exceeded some estimates – but those same models now show a dip following the commodity pullback, which is indeed occurring. The key point: oilfield service earnings **follow oil prices with a delay** and can swing even more in percentage terms, as seen by HAL’s ~170% EPS rise from 2021 to 2023 and then a ~50% fall into 2025.

**Schlumberger (SLB):** (branded as SLB now)  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Schlumberger, as the world’s largest oilfield services provider, has a broad international footprint. Its business is slightly less exposed to the quick swings of U.S. shale and more to longer-cycle international projects (which smoothens the extremes somewhat). Still, SLB’s earnings growth correlates strongly with global upstream spending. During down cycles, SLB has historically seen profits evaporate, and in upcycles they surge. We estimate that a sustained $10 increase in Brent could eventually drive **~10–15% higher revenue for SLB and perhaps 20%+ higher EPS**, given operating leverage. In concrete terms, SLB’s EPS was around $1.30 in 2021, rising to ~$2.20 in 2022 and over $3.00 in 2023 as oil prices stayed high. That ~$1.00+ EPS jump from 2021 to 2022 aligns with the rising oil environment. Unlike HAL, SLB benefits from offshore and international projects that ramp up a bit slower but last longer. Thus, **SLB’s sensitivity unfolds over a couple of years** – a $10 oil price rise that is sustained can lead to a multi-year upswing in SLB’s earnings (long-term contracts, etc.). Its management indicated that 2023 was a breakout year due to broad-based investment by producers. Overall, **SLB might gain on the order of $0.20–$0.30 incremental EPS for each $10 oil increase**, realized gradually (given ~1.4 billion shares, this equates to roughly $280–$420 million net income increase per $10).  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$2.25; 2026: ~$2.40** (estimated). (SLB’s EPS in 2024 is tracking around $2.00; analysts forecast moderate growth into 2025–26 as international projects continue, despite near-term U.S. softness.) If oil prices recover strongly, these numbers could be revised upward – SLB is generally seen as mid-upcycle.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **$52.38**; High $58; Low $43 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/SLB/#:~:text=SLB%20in%20the%20last%203,74)). The stock trades around $50, so consensus sees a few points of upside (+3.2%). The ratings skew positive (Moderate Buy consensus) as SLB is a quality leader. The relatively tight target range suggests analysts have somewhat aligned expectations for SLB (most see mid-$50s as fair value under current oil scenarios).  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** Schlumberger’s business is almost entirely oil and gas services – but diversified across **geographies and service lines**. It generates revenue from reservoir characterization, drilling services, completion services, and production management. **By region**, about 80% of SLB’s revenue comes from international markets (Middle East, Latin America, Europe, etc.) and ~20% from North America. This global diversification means SLB benefits from offshore and OPEC-country spending which often remains robust even if U.S. shale slows. For example, in 2022, Middle East and Latin America drove SLB’s growth. **No part of SLB’s revenue is fixed-fee or commodity-linked**; it all depends on activity levels and service pricing. During the 2020 downturn, SLB’s earnings turned to losses; by 2022, margins rebounded as utilization rose. The **mix** of offerings (high-tech services, integrated projects) gives SLB slightly steadier margins than pure pressure pumping companies – but ultimately, **SLB’s earnings rise and fall with global E&P investment**. In 2022–23, SLB saw strong margin expansion as higher oil incentivized more complex drilling work. In short, **SLB’s revenue mix is broad but uniformly tied to upstream capex, making its earnings sensitive to oil markets worldwide**.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Schlumberger saw a **major earnings recovery in 2022–2023**, confirming the expected lagged response to oil prices. In 2022, SLB’s net income jumped ~83% year-on-year and EPS reached around $2.20 (versus ~$1.30 in 2021), as $100+ oil fueled global drilling programs. By 2023, SLB’s EPS exceeded $3, reflecting another ~40% jump, buoyed by huge international demand (the Middle East, for instance, ramped up capacity) – even while North American growth slowed a bit. This overshoot many sell-side models which had projected a slower ramp; SLB benefited from a **“super-cycle” dynamic** where international spending accelerated faster than anticipated. However, moving into 2024–25, with oil off its highs and some budget tightening, SLB’s growth is leveling off. Recent reports show SLB’s quarterly EPS in late 2024/early 2025 still growing modestly, but the torrid pace of increase has cooled. In essence, **SLB’s actual results validated the thesis that a multi-year oil uptrend (2021–2023) would significantly boost its earnings** – actual EPS came in at or above the high end of analyst ranges, thanks especially to offshore/offshore investments. Conversely, should oil weaken markedly, one would expect SLB’s earnings to underperform forecasts with a similar lag. The 2022 spike clearly lifted all regions for SLB, emphasizing that its sensitivity is global: it capitalized on the boom perhaps more strongly internationally than some anticipated, illustrating the potent leverage of large projects in a high-oil-price environment.

**Baker Hughes (BKR):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Baker Hughes is a hybrid of oilfield services and energy technology (including LNG equipment and turbomachinery). Its sensitivity to oil is a bit more nuanced. The Oilfield Services & Equipment (OFSE) segment (drilling services, completions, etc.) benefits from higher oil via increased rig counts, similar to HAL/SLB. Meanwhile, its Turbomachinery & Process Solutions segment depends on longer-cycle LNG and refinery projects (driven by broader energy demand and gas prices). In general, **sustained high oil prices lead to more upstream orders for BKR and improved OFSE margins**, but the company’s EPS is somewhat less volatile than pure service peers due to its industrial segment. We estimate roughly **+$0.10–$0.15 EPS per $10 oil in the short/medium term**, building to perhaps +$0.20–$0.25 over longer periods if LNG project awards also rise. For perspective, BKR’s adjusted net income in Q1 2025 was up 19% year-on-year despite flat oil prices ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Net%20income%20under%20U,compared%20to%20last%20year)), mainly because of strength in its industrial tech division. However, in the 2020 oil crash, BKR’s earnings collapsed, and in the 2022 rebound, profits improved. So, **BKR is positively correlated with oil, but the direct EPS impact is muted by its diversification** – e.g. its 2022 EPS was ~$0.90, up from near breakeven in 2021, and climbed over $1.00 in 2023 as oil stayed strong. This suggests significant percentage gains, but on a smaller EPS base (and some benefit from LNG equipment orders which are not immediate to oil prices).  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$1.50; 2026: ~$1.70.** Baker Hughes is expected to grow earnings as it restructures and benefits from secular LNG build-out. These numbers assume a decent oil price to support OFSE; if oil goes much higher, there could be upside to these EPS from more orders and better service pricing.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** (approximate, as we didn’t retrieve exact figures) Average around **$36–$38**; High ~$45; Low ~$30. For instance, one source noted an average target ~$40.8 ([www.directorstalkinterviews.com](https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/baker-hughes-company-share-price-target-40.82-now-21.9-upside-potential/#:~:text=Baker%20Hughes%20Company%20Share%20Price,BKR)). BKR’s stock around $34–$35 has some upside in analysts’ view (consensus rating is **Buy/Strong Buy**, given its unique positioning in energy transition equipment plus oil services). The range reflects varying opinions on how fast its LNG and new energy businesses ramp up alongside oilfield activity.  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** Baker Hughes has **two main segments**: *Oilfield Services & Equipment* (~55% of revenue) and *Industrial & Energy Technology* (~45%). The OFSE segment’s revenue and margins depend on drilling activity (onshore and offshore) – similar to HAL/SLB, it rises with more wells drilled and completed. The IET segment includes turbomachinery (e.g. LNG compressors, power gen turbines) and digital solutions, which depend on capital projects like LNG export terminals, gas storage facilities, etc. **Thus, BKR’s mix ties it both to oil and to natural gas/LNG and even downstream investments.** In 2022, for example, strong orders for LNG equipment and refinery pumps cushioned results even when N. America rig growth paused. This mix makes BKR slightly **less directly exposed to quarterly oil price swings**. That said, about half of BKR’s business (OFSE) is still driven by upstream capex – in Q1 2025, the OFSE segment saw weaker results as North American activity fell, partially offset by the IET segment’s growth ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Baker%20Hughes%20reported%20%246,OFSE)). In summary, **BKR’s earnings come from both drilling/service contracts (oil-driven) and longer-cycle equipment sales (less immediately oil-driven)**, giving it a diversified sensitivity. It will benefit from a high-oil-price environment (more drilling and project FIDs), but it also benefits from trends like energy infrastructure build-out that aren’t purely oil-price dependent.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Baker Hughes’ 2022 performance was mixed but generally improved with commodity tailwinds. It swung from a large 2020 loss to modest profitability in 2021, then in 2022 saw **earnings strengthen significantly** as oil stayed high and global investment picked up. However, BKR also faced supply chain issues and one-off charges in 2022, so its full-year EPS (~$0.90) was not as high as it could have been in a perfect scenario. By 2023, with oil still relatively strong and a surge in LNG projects (thanks in part to the energy crisis), BKR’s adjusted EPS rose further (crossing $1). Notably, in early 2023 many sell-side models predicted robust growth for BKR not just from oilfield activity but also from LNG orders; this materialized as anticipated – e.g. BKR reported its turbomachinery orders were booming. During the 2022 spike, BKR’s oilfield services segment did lag slightly behind peers due to its offshore weighting (offshore projects have longer lead times), but by late 2022 and 2023 it saw clear benefits. Actual results showed *less quarter-to-quarter volatility* than pure service companies – for example, while HAL had a blowout Q4 2022, BKR’s results were steadier. This was in line with sensitivity expectations: **the company’s diversification meant it didn’t jump as sharply as a HAL/SLB in the upturn, but also isn’t falling as sharply in the current softness**. Indeed, BKR’s Q1 2025 adjusted net income was up year-on-year despite lower oil vs a year prior ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Net%20income%20under%20U,compared%20to%20last%20year)), thanks to its IET segment – a testimony to its different drivers. In summary, the 2022 oil spike confirmed a moderate positive impact on BKR’s earnings – analysts’ projected improvement did occur, but within the bounds of its multi-pronged business. The **open question** is how much of BKR’s future growth will come from oilfield ups and downs versus structural growth in LNG and low-carbon tech (see “Open Questions” below).

**TechnipFMC (FTI):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** TechnipFMC is an oilfield equipment and engineering firm specializing in subsea production systems and flexible pipelines. Its fortunes are tied to offshore oil project sanctioning. Thus, high oil prices – if sustained – spur more deepwater project approvals (think major subsea developments), which in turn fill TechnipFMC’s order book. The sensitivity is **heavily lagged**: $100 oil today might lead to new contracts awarded to FTI 6–12 months later, and revenue 1–3 years out as equipment is delivered. In terms of magnitude, a $10 rise in Brent that is expected to persist can significantly boost FTI’s backlog and eventually its profits. For example, following the 2022 spike, offshore project final investment decisions (FIDs) increased, benefiting TechnipFMC – the company won large subsea equipment orders through 2023 as operators like Petrobras and TotalEnergies expanded development plans. We can’t easily quantify “$X EPS per $10,” but we can note that **FTI’s EBITDA and EPS tend to rise in cycles when offshore capex increases**. In the previous cycle (2010–2014, high oil), Technip (pre-merger) had strong profits; in the 2015–2020 downturn, profits shrank or turned to losses. Currently, FTI is recovering: it went from negative EPS in 2020–21 to positive ~$0.30 in 2022 and projected >$0.50 in 2024. If oil remains in the $80+ range, FTI’s 2025–26 EPS could climb toward $1.00+. In short, **TechnipFMC’s earnings sensitivity is high but delayed** – major oil price moves affect its order intake and margins over multi-year periods.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$0.60; 2026: ~$0.75.** Analysts expect robust growth as FTI executes its record subsea backlog. These figures assume continued favorable market conditions. (Notably, some analysts have much higher 2025 EPS forecasts if execution is smooth and margins improve – reflecting optimism about the offshore upcycle.)  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average roughly **$50**; High ~$56; Low ~$47 (these are converted from some reports listing in EUR/CHF – e.g. ~$39.96 EUR average which equates to high-$40s USD) ([www.tipranks.com](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/de%3A1t1/forecast#:~:text=TechnipFMC%20,List%20of%20Analyst%20Forecasts%E2%80%8B%20Detailed)). In a recent analysis, Susquehanna raised their target to $56 and Jefferies to $50 ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/technipfmc-plc-nysefti-given-average-rating-of-moderate-buy-by-analysts-2026-02-01/#:~:text=Several%20analysts%20have%20commented%20on,00%20price%20target%20on%20TechnipFMC)), indicating bullish sentiment. Indeed, TechnipFMC has a **Moderate Buy** rating and substantial upside predicted by many (some see it as an underappreciated beneficiary of offshore resurgence). The target spread is narrower – most analysts are clustered in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s, reflecting agreement that the company’s turnaround is underway.  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** TechnipFMC’s revenue comes from **subsea project contracts (about 80%) and surface production systems (about 20%)**. The subsea segment involves engineering and manufacturing hardware for offshore oil & gas production – this is lumpy, project-based revenue that depends on oil companies greenlighting new developments. Surface systems (like wellheads for land drilling) are a smaller, more steady business tied to onshore activity. **Therefore, the vast majority of FTI’s business is directly linked to upstream development spending, especially offshore.** It has no midstream/refining exposure and no sizable recurring fee income. However, its projects are long-cycle – once a subsea project is approved, the work (and revenue) can continue for years, providing some visibility. During high oil price periods, FTI’s backlog swells (which is happening now – the company recently reported a $12+ billion subsea backlog, its highest in years). In low-price times, orders dry up. So the **mix is essentially 100% oilfield capex**, weighted to offshore. The difference from a Halliburton is timing and margin profile: TechnipFMC’s revenue might hold up for a while even after an oil price drop (due to executing backlog), but eventually declines if new orders stop. Conversely, after an oil price rise, it takes time to see the revenue, but when it comes it’s substantial. The earnings profile thus follows the **offshore investment cycle** – currently on an upswing thanks to $80+ oil.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** The 2022 price surge marked a turning point for TechnipFMC. After years of lean activity, **offshore operators sanctioned more projects in late 2022 and 2023**, directly benefiting FTI’s order book. For instance, TechnipFMC’s inbound orders and backlog in 2023 reached multi-year highs, driven by projects in Brazil, West Africa, and the Middle East – a clear result of higher oil incentivizing offshore drilling. Financially, FTI returned to profitability: it reported positive net income in 2022 and improved earnings in 2023. Analysts had anticipated this rebound, and indeed TechnipFMC’s **actual results have aligned with the improving outlook**. By Q4 2023, the company’s EBITDA margins were ticking up as it executed new high-margin projects won post-spike. One concrete example: Susquehanna boosted their target for FTI, citing increased project awards amid the favorable oil environment ([www.marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/technipfmc-plc-nysefti-given-average-rating-of-moderate-buy-by-analysts-2026-02-01/#:~:text=Several%20analysts%20have%20commented%20on,00%20price%20target%20on%20TechnipFMC)). While the full EPS impact of $120 oil in 2022 will be realized over several years of project execution, early signs in 2023–24 show **FTI outperforming initial expectations** – e.g. the company upgraded its 2023 guidance as backlog conversion accelerated. However, challenges like supply chain and inflation have also been noted (could constrain margin upside). Still, the war-driven oil spike scenario (e.g. a Middle East conflict pushing oil up) would likely further boost offshore investment appetites, potentially adding to TechnipFMC’s future earnings beyond current consensus. Thus, **the 2022 spike has validated the thesis that TechnipFMC is a late-cycle winner** – actual order flow and earnings trajectory are positive – but the **full “sensitivity” payoff (higher EPS) is unfolding gradually and is on track to meet or exceed what sell-side models projected for a high-oil-price scenario**.

*(Overall, the oilfield service and equipment group shows that **their earnings react with a lag and can be even more volatile in percentage terms than producers’**. The 2022 oil boom led to outsized 2023 profits for HAL/SLB and a record backlog for FTI – largely confirming model expectations, though timing is everything. Now, with oil off peaks, these firms face a dip (Halliburton already saw it in 2024–25), underlining how the cycle turns.)*

## Midstream & Pipelines: KMI, EPD, ET  
Midstream companies operate oil and gas pipelines, storage, and processing facilities. Their business model is typically fee-based – they earn tariffs for moving or handling volumes, often under long-term contracts. This means **midstream EPS has much lower direct sensitivity to commodity price changes** compared to E&Ps. High or low oil price mainly matters to them if it affects production volumes or if they have certain commodity-linked exposure (like percent-of-proceeds contracts or unhedged processing margins). Below we detail the three midstream names:

**Kinder Morgan (KMI):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Kinder Morgan’s earnings are **minimally sensitive to oil prices**. Around 60% of KMI’s business is natural gas pipelines, 20% products pipelines, 10% terminals, and 10% CO₂ and oil gathering. The vast majority of its transport contracts are fee-based (capacity reservations, take-or-pay agreements) and **do not fluctuate with oil price**. The main exposure KMI has is in its CO₂ segment, which produces and sells some CO₂ and crude oil from enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations in West Texas. That segment’s profit does rise/fall with oil prices. For example, in Q4 2022 KMI noted its realized oil price in the CO₂ unit was up 20% to $65/bbl, boosting that segment’s earnings ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCO_,per%20barrel%2C%20while%20our%20weighted)). However, this impact is relatively small in the context of the whole company. Management has previously indicated that a $1 move in oil changes annual DCF by only a few million dollars (because they hedge much of their CO₂ production). Thus, **a $10/bbl oil increase might move KMI’s EPS by only ~$0.01–$0.02** (nearly negligible). In 2022 when oil soared, KMI’s net income rose about 43% year-over-year ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L79%20of%20%242%2C548,period%20is%20due%20primarily%20to)), but this was largely due to one-time factors and operational growth – not directly oil price (in fact, KMI’s distributable cash flow *declined* slightly in 2022 vs 2021 because 2021 had an extraordinary gas storage profit from Winter Storm Uri). This underscores that **KMI’s cash flows are driven more by volumes and project expansions than commodity prices**. High oil can indirectly help (more crude moving through pipes, higher capacity usage, or producers drilling more gas that needs transport), but these are second-order and gradual effects.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$1.20; 2026: ~$1.25.** KMI’s EPS forecasts are relatively stable, reflecting its utility-like profile. (For reference, KMI expects around $1.12 EPS for 2023 ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=2021%20ir,The%20company%20also%20budgeted%20to)), and modest growth thereafter primarily from new projects and share buybacks.) Unless volumes surge, midstream EPS grows only slowly. Analysts basically model low-single-digit annual EPS/DCF growth for KMI going forward.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **~$19.50**; High ~$21; Low ~$18 (roughly). KMI’s stock is around $18, so the consensus target implies a bit of upside. The range is tight, indicating analysts largely agree on KMI’s valuation. The consensus rating is a **Hold** – midstream names often trade on yield, and KMI’s ~6% dividend yield anchors its price. In short, no one expects big swings – as befits a pipeline company with steady (if unspectacular) outlook.  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** **Kinder Morgan’s cash flows are approximately 90% take-or-pay or fee-based** (per company statements), meaning volume and demand charges dominate. By segment in recent results ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20Natural%20gas,Pipeline%20and%20Natural%20Gas%20Pipeline)) ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L150%20%E2%80%9CCO_,per%20barrel%2C%20while%20our%20weighted)): Natural Gas Pipelines (over half of EBITDA) saw volume growth of 4% in Q4 2022 ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20transport%20volumes%20were,Pipeline%20and%20Natural%20Gas%20Pipeline)) due to LNG exports and power demand – largely unrelated to oil price. Products Pipelines (moving gasoline, diesel, etc.) can see slight variations if fuel demand changes, but those tend to be minor year-on-year (volumes were flat to down a couple percent in Q4 2022) ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L124%20%E2%80%9CContributions%20from,while%20crude%20and%20condensate%20pipeline)); tariffs can adjust for inflation but not directly for oil price. Terminals segment is mostly bulk and liquids storage – again, usage might increase if more product flows during high demand, but those contracts are often fixed. Finally, the CO₂ segment (smallest) **does have earnings tied to oil/NGL prices** – in Q4 2022 that segment’s earnings were “well up” thanks to higher crude/NGL prices ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L150%20%E2%80%9CCO_,per%20barrel%2C%20while%20our%20weighted)). This segment produces a few thousand barrels per day of oil and NGLs; KMI hedges a portion, but rising prices still gave a boost. Overall, however, in 2022 KMI’s **total segment EBDA growth came mostly from increased volumes (natural gas throughput +4%, stronger refined product demand post-COVID) and not from oil price** ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20Natural%20gas,Pipeline%20and%20Natural%20Gas%20Pipeline)) ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20transport%20volumes%20were,Pipeline%20and%20Natural%20Gas%20Pipeline)). In summary, **KMI’s earnings mix is heavily weighted to stable fee revenue from transporting hydrocarbons, with only a minor slice exposed to commodity prices**. Thus it behaves more like an infrastructure/toll company than an oil-levered company.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Kinder Morgan’s actual earnings during the 2022 oil spike barely budged relative to that price change. Net income for full-year 2022 was $2.548B, up slightly from $2.391B in 2021 (excluding a 2021 impairment) ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L79%20of%20%242%2C548,period%20is%20due%20primarily%20to)) – roughly a 7% increase in EPS. Distributable cash flow was actually down ~9% from 2021 ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L79%20of%20%242%2C548,period%20is%20due%20primarily%20to)) because 2021 had that one-time winter storm profit. Clearly, $100+ oil did not translate into outsized gains for KMI. This was expected: **analysts have long noted KMI’s low commodity sensitivity**, and indeed in 2022 while producers and refiners had windfall profits, KMI just delivered its steady results. The only notable upside was in the CO₂ segment, which enjoyed higher realized oil/NGL prices (e.g. 20% higher crude price y/y in Q4 2022) ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCO_,per%20barrel%2C%20while%20our%20weighted)) – but that was a small uplift in absolute dollars. Meanwhile, any potential negatives of high oil (e.g. slightly lower gasoline demand, though minimal) were also small. Essentially, **sell-side models that assumed a negligible EPS impact from commodity swings proved accurate**. KMI performed in line with its contractual business model – providing stability. This also means that in a hypothetical Iran war scenario where oil prices spike, KMI’s financials wouldn’t see a big direct jump – the main positive could be if crude production in safe regions (like the US) increases, leading to more volume through KMI’s pipes over time. But those effects would be slow and limited. In short, **2022 confirmed KMI’s role as a low-beta, income-focused stock in the energy space**, with actual results hewing closely to its guided, price-agnostic trajectory.

**Enterprise Products Partners (EPD):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Enterprise, a large master limited partnership (MLP), operates pipelines and processing plants mainly for natural gas, NGLs (natural gas liquids), petrochemicals, and some crude oil. **Over 85% of EPD’s gross operating margin is based on fee-based contracts**, per company reports, so direct oil-price exposure is minimal. Enterprise does have some commodity-sensitive businesses: NGL fractionation spreads, natural gas processing (if they take a percentage-of-liquids), and minor crude marketing. But the company hedges a lot of this exposure. The net effect is that **a $10 move in oil has only a modest impact on EPD’s distributable cash flow** – likely on the order of a few percent. For example, EPD’s EPS was $2.10 in 2021 and $2.50 in 2022 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EPD/enterprise-products-partners/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www.macrotrends.net%20%20...EPS%20,%241.41%202012)) – an 19% increase, even though oil jumped ~50%. In 2023, EPS was $2.52 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EPD/enterprise-products-partners/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www.macrotrends.net%20%20...EPS%20,%241.41%202012)), essentially flat despite lower oil, showing resilience. This stability indicates **EPD’s earnings barely fluctuate with oil**. Management often emphasizes that volume throughput and demand for petrochemicals drive their results more. A sudden oil spike could marginally expand NGL processing margins if gas plants recover more valuable liquids, but EPD’s scale means it won’t be very material. Conversely, a crash might trim some processing profit but leave long-haul pipeline fees intact. So qualitatively, **EPD’s EPS might change by perhaps 1–2% for a $10 oil move**, if that.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$2.70; 2026: ~$2.75–$2.80.** Enterprise’s EPS is projected to grow slowly in coming years, consistent with new projects coming online (petrochemical expansions, export terminals) and routine growth. These estimates are only slightly above the 2023–24 levels, reflecting the expectation of consistent, fee-driven performance.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **$30–$31**; High ~$33; Low ~$28. EPD trades around $27–$28 currently, and analysts generally see a bit of upside plus a ~7.5% yield – it’s widely viewed as a solid income play. The consensus recommendation is usually **Buy or Outperform**, due to EPD’s strong balance sheet and reliable distribution. The narrow target range highlights the low-risk, low-variance nature of the stock.  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** **Enterprise’s earnings come from a diversified midstream portfolio:** natural gas pipelines and processing (~30% of gross operating margin), NGL pipelines, fractionators, and export facilities (~50%), crude oil pipelines and storage (~10%), and petrochemical/refined product services (~10%). The common theme is that most of these generate fixed fees per unit volume. For instance, EPD transports NGLs and charges a tariff per barrel – those fees don’t change if NGL or oil prices rise, only if more barrels flow. Similarly, its gas processing contracts are often fee-based or have hedged commodity exposure. The company has stated in investor presentations that **it is predominantly fee-based with minimal direct commodity risk** (they sometimes quantify commodity-exposed EBITDA at <5–10% of total, largely hedged). Empirical evidence: in 2020’s price crash, EPD still covered its distribution; in 2022’s boom, it did not suddenly double profits. Instead, volumes are key: in 2022, EPD saw record export volumes of LPG and natural gas liquids due to strong global demand – this helped profits, but that was volume- and margin-based, not simply price. In Q2 2022, for example, EPD’s petrochemical segment did benefit from wider propane handling spreads (propane prices up with oil), but its oil pipelines actually saw lower tariffs due to contract structures despite higher oil prices. Overall, **EPD’s mix is intentionally structured to be resilient**: whether oil is $60 or $100, pipelines still collect their tolls. **Natural gas and NGL throughput (linked to domestic production levels) are more significant variables** – those can indirectly be influenced by oil (e.g. more associated gas if oil production rises), but EPD’s contracts often guarantee minimum volume payments.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Enterprise’s performance in 2022 demonstrated its stability. **EPS rose marginally from $2.10 (2021) to $2.50 (2022) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EPD/enterprise-products-partners/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www.macrotrends.net%20%20...EPS%20,%241.41%202012))**, and DCF hit record levels, but this was mostly due to increased volumes of NGLs and natural gas and new assets in service rather than oil price itself. Analysts had predicted that EPD would be one of the *least* affected by volatile oil markets – and that proved true. While producers had wild swings and refiners had record crack spreads, EPD just kept churning out steady cash flows. Notably, EPD’s distribution was increased modestly in 2022, reflecting confidence in long-term cash flow, not a one-time windfall. The company did enjoy some uplift in its processing business due to higher NGL prices (which track oil to a degree), but concurrently its gas marketing results were less pronounced than in 2021 (when Winter Storm Uri provided a one-off gain). On the whole, **sell-side expectations that EPD would be a “sleepy” beneficiary were correct** – actual EBITDA was very close to budget. For example, EPD’s gross operating margin for 2022 was about $9.3B, up from $8.6B in 2021 – a steady ~8% rise that largely came from volume growth and improved export premiums, not directly from each $ of oil. In downturns, similarly, EPD has outperformed upstream companies by maintaining earnings. This all reinforces that **EPD’s EPS sensitivity to oil is negligible, and 2022’s spike did not materially alter the trajectory that analysts had forecast** (except to perhaps bolster confidence that volumes would remain strong in its system). 

**Energy Transfer (ET):**  
- **Oil Price EPS Sensitivity:** Energy Transfer is another large midstream MLP with assets spanning natural gas pipelines, NGL fractionation, crude oil pipelines (notably the Dakota Access Pipeline), LNG export (Canada project in development), etc. Like EPD, ET’s earnings are predominantly fee-based, so oil price swings have limited direct effect. ET does have some marketing operations and minor processing exposure. Overall, expect **very low EPS sensitivity to oil – perhaps on the order of 1–2% change in EBITDA for a $10 move**. Indeed, ET’s adjusted EBITDA was ~$13.1B in 2022, up from ~$12.3B in 2021, largely due to acquired assets and volume growth, not oil price. Its 2020 EBITDA (low price year) was still ~$10.5B, showing resilience. In terms of EPS, ET’s common unit earnings were $1.86 in 2022 and $1.26 in 2023 (the drop was due to one-time gains in 2022 and higher interest expense, not oil). The small change despite a big oil price swing underscores the weak correlation. **High oil can indirectly help ET if it leads to more production in areas ET serves (Permian, Bakken), filling their pipelines**, but these volume gains usually lag and are constrained by contract terms. In summary, **ET’s EPS might hardly move with oil** – any notable impacts would come if oil stays extreme long enough to significantly alter U.S. production volumes, which then changes pipeline throughput.  
- **FY2025–26 Consensus EPS:** **2025: ~$1.30; 2026: ~$1.35.** ET’s EPS is forecast to be relatively flat to slightly growing, consistent with its stable business and large debt load (interest costs have risen). The focus for ET is more on distributable cash flow and debt reduction; EPS is not the primary metric for MLPs but is expected to inch up as new projects (like LNG export capacity) come online.  
- **Analyst Price Targets:** Average **~$16**; High ~$18; Low ~$14. ET trades around $13–$14, so the average target indicates ~15% upside plus a ~9–10% yield, reflecting a bullish stance from analysts (many have a Buy rating on valuation grounds). The range of targets is not very wide, implying general agreement on ET’s steady-state value.  
- **Revenue/Earnings Mix:** Energy Transfer’s operations cover **natural gas transportation and storage (the largest segment), NGL fractionation and export (via its Mont Belvieu and Nederland terminals), crude oil pipelines (e.g. DAPL, Texas crude pipes), and refined products terminals**. Like its peers, the vast bulk of ET’s EBITDA comes from fee-based contracts: long-term ship-or-pay agreements on pipelines, fractionation fees per gallon of NGL, storage fees, etc. In 2022, for instance, ET’s Natural Gas Liquids segment saw record volumes of NGLs transported and fractionated – not because oil was high per se, but because U.S. NGL production (linked partly to oil drilling) was robust. Similarly, its crude oil segment’s earnings depend on throughput from producing regions like the Bakken and Permian. Those volumes did increase modestly in 2022 as production rose, helping utilization. **However, ET’s fees did not change with oil price – just the flow volumes did.** The company also has a **“Marketing” segment that can have commodity exposure**, but it’s relatively small and often hedged (and can even benefit in volatile markets by capturing arbitrage opportunities). For context, ET’s 2021 results were hugely boosted by Winter Storm Uri (a one-time gas trading profit); excluding that, the variability in ET’s earnings from commodity swings is low. In normal conditions, **over 85% of ET’s margins are fee-based or hedged**. Thus, like KMI and EPD, **ET’s earnings mix is predominantly midstream tolls**, with any oil price effect coming indirectly via producer activity levels.  
- **2022 Oil Spike Impact:** Energy Transfer’s performance during 2022 again demonstrated the midstream pattern: **little direct impact from oil’s jump, aside from higher volumes**. ET’s adjusted EBITDA for 2022 was up about 6–7% from 2021 (excluding the 2021 storm benefit), mainly due to acquisitions (Enable Midstream) and higher NGL export volumes. Crude oil pipelines saw slightly higher throughput as U.S. oil production grew ~5%. These incremental gains were anticipated by analysts, who note that ET’s DCF is **more sensitive to natural gas and NGL volumes** (which were strong as associated gas output climbed and international demand for LPG was high) than to the price of oil itself. Indeed, ET met or slightly beat its 2022 guidance, which had assumed much lower commodity prices than actually occurred – meaning the commodity upside mostly accrued to producers, not ET. For instance, ET’s fractionation business largely operates on fixed fees per gallon, so even though NGL prices spiked along with oil in early 2022, ET’s margin per unit was fixed – if anything, high prices might have marginally reduced petrochemical demand for NGLs, but global demand stayed high so volumes held. In analysts’ models, ET was expected to generate roughly $1.2+ per unit in DCF in 2022; it did so handily, but did not hugely exceed forecasts because commodity price wasn’t the limiting factor. Therefore, **actual results lined up with the view that ET has low oil beta**. Going forward, ET’s growth drivers (new LNG export contracts, pipeline expansions) are more project-driven than price-driven. In summary, the 2022 oil spike gave ET a *slight* tailwind via volume and export demand, but nothing transformative – validating sell-side positioning of ET as a high-yield value play relatively insulated from commodity volatility.

*(The midstream group overall confirms that **their EPS/DCF are far less volatile with oil prices**. 2022’s extreme oil rally did not produce huge upside surprises for these names – they delivered steady growth roughly as projected. This is crucial for understanding risk/reward: in an Iran-war oil spike scenario, these pipeline operators would be the “low risk, low reward” cards – their cash flows might tick up a bit if volumes grow, but they won’t see windfall profits like upstream producers would. Conversely, if oil prices collapse, they keep earning through fixed fees, with maybe slight volume attrition. Their sensitivity lies in *throughput volumes and project investments*, not directly the commodity price.)*

## Key Findings and Takeaways  

- **EPS Sensitivities Vary Dramatically by Subsector:** Upstream-oriented companies like **COP** have the highest direct sensitivity – on the order of **+$2–3 EPS for each $10 rise in oil**, as evidenced by COP’s doubling of EPS from 2021 to 2022 in step with oil ([www.conocophillips.com](https://www.conocophillips.com/news-media/story/conocophillips-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2022-results-and-176-preliminary-reserve-replacement-ratio-announces-2023-guidance-and-planned-return-of-capital-of-11-billion-declares-quarterly-dividend-and-variable-return-of-cash-distribution/#:~:text=Full,01%20per%20share)). Integrated majors **XOM and CVX** also benefit strongly – roughly **+$0.8–1.0 EPS per $10** in our estimates – but with some cushioning from their downstream units (which can either mitigate or enhance the impact depending on refining margins). Oilfield service firms (**HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI**) do not follow a simple per-$10 rule but rather see **amplified earnings growth with a lag**: a price spike leads to significantly higher profits a few quarters later (HAL’s EPS jumped ~69% in the year after the 2022 oil spike ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)), SLB’s ~40%+), meaning their “sensitivity” is best measured in terms of activity levels (rig count up X% => earnings up Y%). In contrast, midstream pipeline operators (**KMI, EPD, ET**) have **minimal EPS changes for a given oil price swing** – likely only a few cents or a few percentage points move for a $10 change, since their revenues are locked in by contracts. For example, EPD’s EPS was essentially flat between 2021 and 2023 (${2.10 → $2.50 → $2.52) while oil ranged from $70 to $100+ ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EPD/enterprise-products-partners/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www.macrotrends.net%20%20...EPS%20,%241.41%202012)). 

- **Current Consensus Reflects Commodity Expectations:** Analyst consensus EPS for **2025 and 2026** is generally **lower for upstream-sensitive names** compared to recent actuals, due to assumptions of lower oil prices. For instance, **Chevron’s 2025 EPS is forecast around $6.6** (down from $9.7 in 2024) ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVX/chevron/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%2418.28%202021)), and **COP’s 2025 ~ $8.5** vs $13+ achieved in 2022 – consistent with oil price decks in the $70s or lower. In contrast, **midstream EPS forecasts for 2025/26 are stable or slightly rising** (KMI ~$1.12 in 2023 to ~$1.20 in 2025 ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=2021%20ir,The%20company%20also%20budgeted%20to)); EPD ~$2.69 in 2024 to ~$2.75 by 2026 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EPD/enterprise-products-partners/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www.macrotrends.net%20%20...EPS%20,%241.41%202012))) as these companies’ growth is not tied to oil price. For oilfield services, consensus anticipates a dip then recovery: e.g. **Halliburton $1.5–$1.6 in 2025** (down from ~$2.8 in 2023) and rising afterwards, reflecting the current soft patch followed by a potential new upcycle. It’s important to note these estimates could swing if oil price assumptions change dramatically (e.g., a war-related spike would likely cause analysts to raise 2025–26 EPS estimates for the producers and servicers substantially, while leaving midstream mostly unchanged).

- **Analyst Price Targets and Sentiment:** The **mean price targets** for each stock (with ranges) give insight into perceived risk/reward. **COP, XOM, CVX** have decent upside implied (e.g. COP’s avg PT is $115, ~5% above current ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/COP/#:~:text=ConocoPhillips%20in%20the%20last%203,05)); XOM’s $142 average is slightly below current price ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/XOM/#:~:text=Exxon%20Mobil%20in%20the%20last,88)) but high targets reach $171 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/XOM/#:~:text=Exxon%20Mobil%20in%20the%20last,88))). This suggests analysts see integrateds and E&Ps as fairly valued to modestly undervalued – likely assuming oil stays around mid-$70s. **Oilfield services (HAL, SLB, BKR)** generally have Buy ratings and targets above current prices (HAL ~$35 vs current ~$35 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/HAL/#:~:text=Halliburton%20in%20the%20last%203,01)), SLB ~$52 vs ~$50 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/SLB/#:~:text=SLB%20in%20the%20last%203,74)), BKR ~$40 vs mid-$30s), indicating positive sentiment that the cycle will continue benefiting them. **Midstream targets** (KMI ~$19, EPD ~$30, ET ~$16) are only marginally above current trading levels, reflecting that these are treated as income plays with limited capital appreciation expected – their upside comes mainly from yield unless there’s a significant volume or M&A catalyst. Notably, **target ranges** are much wider for producers and servicers (e.g. CVX $124–$212 ([www.pricetargets.com](https://www.pricetargets.com/NYSE/CVX/#:~:text=Chevron%20in%20the%20last%203,07))) than for midstream (EPD $28–$34, a tight range), highlighting greater uncertainty/risk attributed to commodity-exposed names. This aligns with the idea that in a high-oil scenario (like a geopolitical supply shock), the producers and service stocks could see significant re-rating upward (toward the high end of target range or beyond), whereas midstreams might not move as much because their fundamental cash flows wouldn’t drastically change.

- **Revenue and Earnings Mix Differences Explain Sensitivities:** The analysis of each company’s revenue/earnings mix makes clear **why sensitivities differ**. **Upstream companies (COP)** derive ~100% of earnings from selling oil & gas, so naturally their EPS is directly proportional to price. **Integrated majors (XOM, CVX)** still get ~70–80% of earnings from upstream in high-price environments ([chevroncorp.gcs-web.com](https://chevroncorp.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chevron-announces-third-quarter-2022-results#:~:text=,)), but the remainder from refining/chemicals can either offset or accentuate oil price effects. For instance, in 2022 both Exxon and Chevron saw refining profits jump due to tight fuel markets, adding to their upstream gains – but in a scenario where oil spikes rapidly, refining margins can sometimes compress if product prices lag, partially offsetting upstream gains (one reason Exxon’s own sensitivity might be less than a pure E&P). **Oilfield services (HAL, SLB)** have earnings tied to customer capex – their “mix” is basically different service lines all linked to drilling/completion activity. HAL is more North America-focused (short-cycle shale), which is very responsive to price changes, whereas SLB is more international/offshore (medium-cycle, smoother). This mix difference meant HAL’s earnings swung faster and more extremely than SLB’s around the 2022 spike. **Baker Hughes** has a mix of oilfield service and industrial energy tech, so part of its business benefited from LNG and downstream investments (less tied to immediate oil price) – this gave it a smoother ride. **TechnipFMC** is almost entirely tied to offshore project FIDs, hence heavily oil-driven but on a long delay – its revenue mix (subsea equipment vs onshore) is all upstream investment, just spread over project timelines. **Midstream (KMI, EPD, ET)** revenue is predominantly fee-based: transporting a barrel or an Mcf yields the same fee regardless of commodity price. Thus their earnings mix is intentionally resistant to price volatility. For them, what matters more are **volumes (throughput)** and **sometimes product differentials**. For example, EPD and ET generate some earnings from fractionation spreads (the price difference between NGL components like propane and natural gas) – these spreads can widen with higher oil (propane often indexed to oil, gas not as much), giving a minor boost. Also, if high oil stimulates more production in regions their systems serve, they may see volume-based revenue uptick (as long as pipeline capacity isn’t already full). Conversely, if low prices curtail production, volumes – and thus revenues – could decline. So while midstreams aren’t completely immune to sustained price trends (because extreme prices will eventually affect production volumes), their **short-term EPS impact is very limited compared to other sectors**. For instance, KMI highlighted in Q4 2022 that coal-to-gas switching and LNG exports (driven by global gas demand, not oil price) moved their volumes, whereas their CO₂ EOR profit rose with oil price ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L150%20%E2%80%9CCO_,per%20barrel%2C%20while%20our%20weighted)) – a rare direct link. The **bottom line**: each company’s revenue makeup (upstream vs downstream vs services vs tolling) determines how and when oil prices filter into earnings. This is critical for calibrating risk/reward – e.g., COP and HAL will see immediate upside (and downside) from price swings, whereas EPD/ET will remain steady, making them behave almost like bonds in comparison.

- **2022 Oil Spike – Actuals vs Expectations:** The oil surge of 2022 (Brent averaging ~$100+, peaking $120+) provides a real-world test of these sensitivities. **Upstream producers (XOM, CVX, COP)** *outperformed* many models: they delivered record earnings that in some cases **exceeded** linear sensitivity predictions because the spike also tightened refining and gas markets, creating **ancillary profit boosts**. For instance, analysts might have forecast Chevron to earn ~$15 at $100 oil, but it earned $18.28 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVX/chevron/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted/1000#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www,%248.14)) due to exceptional refining margins. Exxon’s $13.26 EPS in 2022 blew past any prior earnings record ([corporate.exxonmobil.com](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/0131_exxonmobil-announces-full-year-2022-results#:~:text=ExxonMobil%20announces%20full)), reflecting both oil and non-oil factors. This suggests that **in extreme scenarios, integrateds can earn windfalls above what a simple $/bbl-to-EPS ratio would indicate**, as their integration lets them capture value at multiple points (upstream, downstream, chemicals). **Pure E&Ps (COP)** basically matched the expected sensitivity – COP’s earnings doubled, exactly in line with the price doubling (no surprise offsets, since it’s pure-play). **Oilfield services** in 2022 were still in recovery mode – actual EPS in 2022 for HAL/SLB were up but not huge (HAL $1.73 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=2022%20%20,1.29)), SLB ~$2.20) as the real surge came in 2023 after contracts repriced. This lag was anticipated by many sell-side models, which projected 2023–24 as the big upcycle for services given the 2022 oil price signal. Indeed, actual 2023 results for HAL and SLB came in very strong (HAL $2.92 EPS ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/HAL/halliburton/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=,increase%20from%202022)), SLB >$3) – close to or above the bullish estimates – confirming the thesis. **Midstream companies** delivered exactly what was expected: stable, incremental growth, **no windfalls** from $120 oil. Their 2022 EBITDA/DCF numbers were almost bang on guidance. For example, EPD’s $2.50 EPS in 2022 was only slightly above 2021’s $2.10 ([www.macrotrends.net](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/EPD/enterprise-products-partners/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted#:~:text=MacroTrends%20www.macrotrends.net%20%20...EPS%20,%241.41%202012)) (consistent with steady fee growth), and KMI’s DCF actually slightly fell year-over-year ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=of%20%242%2C548%20million%2C%20compared%20to,period%20is%20due%20primarily%20to)) (due to prior one-off comps), reinforcing that high oil didn’t really change their financials beyond minor segment upticks (like CO₂). Thus, **the 2022 spike validated the relative sensitivities: E&Ps and integrateds far exceeded baseline earnings, services followed with a boom the next year, and midstream was largely unchanged**. This historical validation gives confidence in using those sensitivity numbers for scenario analysis (e.g., war outbreak scenarios). It also highlights potential *surprises* to watch for: integrateds might earn more than our base sensitivity if refining margins also spike (as often happens in conflict-driven oil crunches), whereas services might take a few quarters longer to ramp but then could overshoot if a capex frenzy occurs after a delay.

- **Midstream vs E&P: Why EPS Sensitivity Differs and Volume Matters:** The midstream names (KMI, EPD, ET) underscore that **volume and throughput are more critical than oil price** for their earnings. Their revenues come from transporting X million barrels or cubic feet – so the key drivers are **production volumes, export volumes, and demand for pipeline capacity**. These, in turn, depend on producers’ investment and end-user consumption. For instance, if an Iran war kept oil at $120 for a year, U.S. shale producers might increase drilling, eventually boosting oil output by, say, a few hundred thousand barrels per day – that could fill more pipeline space and slightly increase midstream revenues (and possibly allow pipelines to charge spot tariffs if capacity tightens). But these effects are gradual and often limited by contract structures. Additionally, natural gas-focused midstreams (like KMI, which is predominantly gas) rely on gas production and demand. Gas often has its own dynamics (weather, LNG exports); in 2022, KMI’s volumes were more influenced by a cold winter and coal plant retirements increasing gas power burn ([ir.kindermorgan.com](https://ir.kindermorgan.com/news/news-details/2023/Kinder-Morgan-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Earnings-Per-Share-up-7-and-Distributable-Cash-Flow-Per-Share-up-13-Versus-the-Fourth-Quarter-Of-2021/default.aspx#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20Natural%20gas,Pipeline%20and%20Natural%20Gas%20Pipeline)) than by oil. So **midstreams care more about *throughput metrics*: pipeline volumes (BBLs or MMBtu transported), fractionation volumes (NGLs processed), capacity utilization rates**. Many of those are locked in via reservations – e.g., producers pay KMI whether or not they fully use their contracted pipeline space. That’s why midstream cash flows are steady. When oil crashed in 2020, volumes did dip but not catastrophically; when oil spiked in 2022, volumes rose modestly but there was spare capacity, so revenue didn’t jump proportionally. In sum, **midstream EPS sensitivity is low because their business model externalizes commodity risk onto shippers**. Instead, investors monitor project developments (new pipelines, LNG terminals) and **volume outlooks** (will Permian production exceed pipe capacity?) – those determine growth. A war that jolts oil price might not move the needle for midstream unless it fundamentally shifts the long-term oil/gas production trajectory or causes short-term dislocations that midstream companies can capitalize on (like storage arbitrage or differentials widening – which typically benefit traders more than pipeline owners). Therefore, **midstream EPS remains relatively stable across oil scenarios**, acting more like utilities. This is crucial for trade positioning: midstreams are lower-risk, yield-oriented plays with less upside in a bull oil case but also less downside in a bear case.

- **Oilfield Services: Lag and Drivers (Rig Counts, Capex budgets):** The oil services and equipment firms illustrate how **their fate lags the commodity trend**. Key drivers for their EPS are **rig count (number of active drilling rigs), well completions count, capital expenditure budgets of E&Ps, and pricing for service contracts**. Rig count is a good proxy – for example, the U.S. land rig count climbed dramatically from mid-2021 into 2022 as oil prices rose, reaching around 800 rigs in early 2023 (from ~250 in mid-2020). This directly translated to higher revenue for HAL’s drilling and completions divisions. However, the **lag** comes from E&P behavior: companies don’t adjust drilling immediately with price – it takes a few months to plan, budget, and mobilize rigs. Additionally, modern E&Ps tend to be more disciplined, so they didn’t ramp up as frenetically as in past cycles. This meant the service upturn, while strong, was not as explosive as, say, 2010–2014, but still significant. Another factor: **international vs North America timing** – international projects (offshore) took until late 2022 into 2023 to really respond (as evident with SLB’s 2023 boom), whereas North America responded in late 2021 through 2022 (feeding HAL’s 2022–early 2023 strength). The **drivers for service EPS** include not just rig count numbers but **service pricing**. When equipment (like pressure pumping spreads or drillships) is fully utilized, service companies can charge higher day-rates. This greatly boosts margins – which is why HAL’s operating income jumped so much by Q4 2022/Q1 2023 ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Total%20revenue%20for%20the%20quarter,987%20million%20a%20year%20ago)) once their fleet was busy and pricing power returned. In 2022, service pricing was on the rise; in 2023 it peaked; and by 2024, with rig count falling (U.S. rig count dropped from ~780 in early 2023 to ~600 by late 2023), competition increased and some pricing concessions emerged, squeezing service margins again. So, **their EPS is tied to the capital spending cycle – up rapidly when spend increases, and down when spend tightens, with oil price the underlying trigger**. We saw this in Halliburton’s earnings: Q1 2025 net income down ~66% y/y as North American revenue fell with fewer rigs ([globalcarbonfund.com](https://globalcarbonfund.com/carbon-news/oilfield-giants-walk-a-tightrope-q1-profits-emissions-the-race-to-net-zero/#:~:text=Halliburton%20Company%20reported%20a%20net,the%20same%20period%20last%20year)). The global spend outlook drives SLB – in Q1 2025 SLB was still seeing international growth (hence holding up better). **In summary, oilfield service EPS tends to lag oil by ~6 months (North America) to ~1 year+ (international/offshore)**. Rig count and upstream budget guidance are key forward indicators for their performance. If a war causes oil to spike and, importantly, **stay elevated for several months, E&Ps are likely to boost capex plans the next quarter or two, which then means by 2H or end of that year, service companies will be busier and push through price hikes – lifting their EPS.** This lag is crucial for timing trades: service stock prices often anticipate this (e.g., rallied in 2022 expecting 2023 earnings jump). Similarly, when oil falls sharply, service firm earnings don’t immediately collapse – they have backlog and ongoing projects – but new orders slow and within a couple of quarters utilization drops, hitting EPS (as happened from mid-2023 into 2024). 

## Open Questions / Further Investigation Areas  

Our research highlights several points that warrant further analysis or monitoring:

- **Dynamic vs Static Sensitivities:** The “EPS per $10 oil” figures we provided are approximate and mostly linear. In reality, sensitivities can be **non-linear** at extreme prices. For example, at very high oil prices ($120+), upstream companies might face windfall taxes or OPEC quotas that alter volume, and refining margins could collapse due to demand destruction – changing the net impact. Similarly at very low prices, producers shut in fields, making sensitivities moot beyond a certain point. An open question is how these companies would behave in *extreme* scenarios (e.g., $150 oil for a year). We might investigate historical cases (like 2008’s spike or 2011–2014) to refine the sensitivity estimates in non-linear regimes.

- **Natural Gas and Products Sensitivity:** We focused on oil (Brent) price, but many of these companies also have significant exposure to **natural gas and LNG prices** or **refining margins**. For instance, COP’s sensitivity includes gas (roughly $0.25–$0.30 EPS per $1 per MMBtu change in Henry Hub, by our estimate). Similarly, midstreams like KMI and EPD are more gas-focused. A question is: **How would a war scenario that spikes oil but not natural gas (or vice versa) affect these companies?** In an Iran war, oil might skyrocket, but U.S. natural gas might not as much (unless global LNG is disrupted). This could mean COP benefits less than an oil-pure E&P since ~35% of its production is gas. It could also mean integrated refiners see margin squeeze if gas (a refinery fuel/feed) diverges. We should examine sensitivity to gas/NGL prices separately and potentially incorporate those into risk/reward charts (especially for gas-heavy names like KMI or diversified ones like XOM which produce 8.5 Bcfd gas ([www.alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nyse/xom/investor-relations/earnings-call/q1-2025#:~:text=XOM%20Q1,value%20product%20volumes)) in addition to liquids).

- **Refining Margin Offsets for Integrated Majors:** Our analysis noted that integrated majors’ net sensitivity depends on refining. In 2022, refining margins hit all-time highs, amplifying majors’ earnings. But if oil spikes due to war, refining margins could behave unpredictably – possibly spiking too if capacity is constrained, or possibly tightening if governments cap fuel prices or demand slumps. **Open question:** *What assumption should we make about refining margins in a war-driven oil spike scenario?* This could alter XOM/CVX’s risk-reward significantly. Further research could look at 1970s or 1990 Gulf War episodes to see how refining margins responded when crude spiked, to better model integrateds.

- **Hedging and Capital Allocation Responses:** Some companies hedge prices (midstreams often hedge NGL processing, producers sometimes hedge future production). If a war breaks out, hedges could limit upside for certain firms. For example, does COP have any hedges that would cap near-term oil upside? (COP usually doesn’t hedge much, but smaller producers do.) Also, will E&Ps stick to “shareholder return” pledges or ramp drilling if oil soars? The answer affects oilfield service prospects. One might need to question management commentary: in recent years, many producers say they’ll **not** dramatically raise capex even if oil goes above $100 – if that holds true (due to investor pressure for discipline), then the oilfield service lagged upside could be weaker than in past cycles. **We may need to investigate current guidance and track record** – e.g., did U.S. shale companies actually increase 2023 budgets when oil averaged $95 in 2022? They largely didn’t, which kept rig count from rising as much as it could have. So an open question: *If war sends oil to $120, will producers like COP, XOM, CVX really invest more (boosting volumes and service demand), or just cash in the profits?* The answer could alter how we visualize risk/reward (perhaps less upside for services, more for pure price-takers).

- **Volume Growth Potential and Constraints:** For midstream, a war scenario might eventually mean more U.S. production and exports to replace disrupted Middle East barrels. We should explore capacity constraints: Are pipelines currently at max utilization in key corridors? (E.g., oil pipelines out of the Permian are nearing full, LNG export terminals are at capacity until new ones start up in 2025+). If volumes can’t grow short-term due to infrastructure limits, midstreams won’t see volume uplift even if oil price is high. Conversely, if high oil hastens final investment decisions on new infrastructure (new pipelines, LNG trains), that could benefit midstream in the long run. So a strategic question: *Do midstream firms stand to gain from secondary effects of a war (infrastructure demand), even if immediate EPS sensitivity is low?* This might not affect immediate EPS but could be relevant for multi-year “reward” scenarios in trade cards.

- **Geopolitical and Operational Risks:** In a war outbreak scenario, it’s not just oil price but also potential **operational disruptions** to consider. For instance, could Iranian retaliation threaten oil traffic in the Persian Gulf, affecting companies like HAL or SLB that have operations in the Middle East? (SLB gets significant revenue from the Middle East; war could both raise oil price and disrupt operations/logistics in the region). Similarly, TechnipFMC’s customers (offshore projects) could face sanctions or delays. These factors are outside pure price sensitivity but crucial for a holistic risk/reward. We might need to research which companies have direct exposure to conflict zones or rely on global supply chains that might be affected (e.g., high steel prices or restricted exports).

- **Consensus Estimates Accuracy:** Our consensus EPS and price target data were compiled from various sources (ChartMill, Macrotrends, pricetargets.com, etc.). There is some **variability between sources** and they may update frequently. To ensure accuracy for final visuals, one might verify the latest consensus from a single consistent source (like Bloomberg or FactSet) at the time of finalizing the trade cards. Also, the range of analyst price targets can change as analysts revise outlook – especially if oil prices move. An open item is to keep these updated. For example, **if oil indeed starts pricing in war risk and rises significantly, analysts will likely raise price targets for XOM, CVX, COP quickly.** The range could shift upward. So the question: *Do we lock in current consensus for our visualization, or dynamically update it if scenario changes?* Perhaps we present current consensus as baseline, and separately consider a “war scenario” adjusted earnings and valuation (e.g., what EPS and stock price might be if Brent $120). This might be beyond scope but is a valuable extension – essentially building our own scenario consensus.

- **Calibration of Risk/Reward Charts:** Finally, translating these findings into the interactive static HTML trade cards with risk/reward charts requires some assumptions. We have concrete EPS sensitivity estimates; to calibrate risk/reward, we must decide on scenarios (e.g., oil baseline $80 vs upside case $120 vs downside case $50) and apply these sensitivities. Open questions here: *What time frame do our risk/reward charts consider for EPS realization?* If it’s 1-year forward, we’d use FY2025 EPS as baseline and adjust it by sensitivity * delta in oil price for the scenario. For services, do we factor the lag or assume market anticipates it? Likely we show potential % change in earnings or stock price under the scenario. We should also clarify that for midstreams, risk/reward is more about yield and maybe slight volume risk, rather than huge EPS swings. Perhaps another metric (like DCF coverage or leverage) is more pertinent risk factor for them than EPS. We might need to address open questions on how to visually represent the much lower volatility of midstream in contrast to the wild swings of upstream.

In conclusion, **accuracy and nuance are critical**. We’ve provided specific numbers and evidence-backed reasoning for each company’s oil-price exposure, but users of this research (and the interactive trade cards) should be aware of the underlying assumptions and the factors beyond crude price that can influence outcomes. Continuous monitoring of real-world data – oil price trajectories, OPEC actions, company guidance updates, etc. – remains important to refine any trade idea built on an Iran-US/Israel conflict scenario. Our findings arm the investigation with a solid foundation of how each stock might behave financially if such a crisis occurs, informing better risk/reward judgments.
