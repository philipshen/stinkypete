# Quick Research: Global Refining Capacity Expansion and "Double Lift" Repeat Potential

## Question
If global refining capacity has expanded since 2022, will the XOM/CVX "double lift" from concurrent refining margin spikes repeat in a 2026 war scenario?

## Key Findings

### Global Refining Capacity Changes Since 2022
- **2022-2024:** Refining capacity grew ~1 million bpd/year (faster than trend)
- **2025-2027 forecast:** Growth decelerating to ~620,000 bpd/year average
- **2025-2029 forecast:** Only 2.1 MMb/d net additions (~422 kb/d/year) -- slowest pace in 30 years
- **Key additions:** Dos Bocas (Mexico, 340 kb/d ramping), Yulong (China), Balikpapan (Indonesia, +100 kb/d), Sriracha (Thailand, +125 kb/d by 2026)
- **Closures offsetting additions:** Europe losing 495 kb/d from German and UK refinery closures

### Regional Dynamics
- **Asia-Pacific:** 3.2 mb/d additions planned through 2030 (largest regional growth)
- **Middle East:** 1 mb/d planned additions -- but these refineries are INSIDE the Hormuz-affected zone
- **Europe:** Capacity contracting -- net loss of ~270 kb/d (2023: 8.47 mb/d to 2025: 8.2 mb/d)
- **US:** Minimal new capacity; focus on efficiency upgrades

### Will the "Double Lift" Repeat?
**MIXED -- Likely partial, not full repeat:**

1. **Supporting the double lift:** European refinery closures create structural tightness. If Middle Eastern refinery output is disrupted (Hormuz), global refined product supply tightens sharply. US refiners (benefiting XOM, CVX) would see margin expansion as the marginal refining barrel becomes more valuable.

2. **Against the double lift:** Net global capacity has grown since 2022. Asia-Pacific additions (China, India, Indonesia) provide more buffer than existed in 2022. The 2022 double lift was partly driven by Russian refined product sanctions -- a unique one-time factor.

3. **Key variable:** If war disrupts Middle Eastern refining output (Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain refineries), the double lift repeats because those refineries account for ~10 mb/d of capacity. If Hormuz is only partially disrupted (harassment scenario), crude spikes but refining margins may actually compress as higher feedstock costs are not fully passed through.

### Implication for Trade Cards
- **XOM/CVX trade cards should model the conservative case** (upstream lift only, no double lift) for base scenarios
- **Upside scenario note:** If Middle Eastern refineries are physically disrupted, add $1.00-2.00/share additional EPS from refining margin expansion
- **COP unaffected** -- pure upstream, no refining exposure
- European refinery closures make the double lift more likely in 2026 than it would have been in a year of high capacity additions
