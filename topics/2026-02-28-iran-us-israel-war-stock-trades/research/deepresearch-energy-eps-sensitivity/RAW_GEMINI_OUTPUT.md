# Energy Stock EPS Sensitivity to Oil Prices: A Comprehensive Analysis

### Executive Summary & Key Findings

For investors analyzing the risk/reward profiles of energy stocks in the context of a potential Iran-US/Israel conflict, the distinction between "price exposure" and "volume exposure" is paramount. Our extensive research into ten key energy tickers (XOM, CVX, COP, HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI, KMI, EPD, ET) reveals three distinct tiers of earnings per share (EPS) sensitivity to crude oil price shocks.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **High Sensitivity (E&Ps/Integrateds):** **ConocoPhillips (COP)**, **ExxonMobil (XOM)**, and **Chevron (CVX)** exhibit the highest direct EPS correlation to oil prices. While XOM and CVX possess downstream refining hedges that dampen volatility, their massive upstream volumes still result in significant EPS uplifts—approximately **$1.50 per share** annually for every $10/bbl increase in Brent for XOM [cite: 1].
2.  **Moderate/Lagged Sensitivity (Services):** **Halliburton (HAL)** and **Schlumberger (SLB)** are second-derivative plays. Their earnings do not spike immediately with oil prices; rather, they rise 6–12 months later as E&P companies adjust capital expenditure (capex) budgets in response to sustained higher prices. **Baker Hughes (BKR)** and **TechnipFMC (FTI)** are further insulated by long-cycle industrial and subsea backlogs, making them less reactive to short-term geopolitical price spikes.
3.  **Low Sensitivity (Midstream):** **Kinder Morgan (KMI)**, **Enterprise Products (EPD)**, and **Energy Transfer (ET)** act as "toll roads." Their sensitivity to oil *price* is negligible (e.g., KMI’s EBITDA fluctuates only ~0.1% per $1/bbl change [cite: 2]). Their primary risk in a war scenario is *volume* curtailment (e.g., Strait of Hormuz closure impacting exports) rather than price realization.

The following report details the specific EPS sensitivities, consensus estimates, and structural drivers for each ticker to calibrate trade card visualizations.

## 1. EPS Sensitivity to Oil Prices
This section quantifies the approximate annualized impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS) for a $10/bbl increase in Brent Crude prices. Data is derived from company sensitivity guidance tables (often labeled "Sensitivities and Key Assumptions") and sell-side modeling.

### Exploration & Production (E&P) and Integrated Majors

| Ticker | Company | Approx. EPS Uplift per $10/bbl Brent Increase | Methodology & Source Data |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XOM** | Exxon Mobil | **~$1.50** | Based on 2025 guidance showing Upstream earnings increase of **$650M per $1/bbl** increase [cite: 1]. With ~4.3B shares outstanding, a $10 increase yields ~$6.5B in net income, or ~$1.51/share. |
| **CVX** | Chevron | **~$2.50 - $2.75** | Derived from guidance indicating ~$450M earnings sensitivity per $1/bbl [cite: 3]. With ~1.8B shares, a $10 increase equals ~$4.5B net income, or ~$2.50/share. |
| **COP** | ConocoPhillips | **~$0.60 (Net Income)**<br>**~$1.80 (Cash Flow)** | COP's 4Q25 guidance explicitly lists Net Income sensitivity at **$65-75M per $1/bbl** [cite: 4]. With ~1.17B shares, this is ~$0.60 EPS per $10/bbl. *Note:* Cash flow sensitivity is significantly higher (~$225M/$1 change), making COP a better cash flow play than EPS play [cite: 4]. |

**Analyst Note on E&P Sensitivity:**
ConocoPhillips (COP) appears to have a lower *EPS* sensitivity ($0.60) compared to its peers despite being an unhedged pure-play. This is due to higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses and tax structures that dampen *net income* volatility relative to *cash flow* volatility. For risk/reward charts, Cash Flow Per Share (CFPS) is often a superior metric for COP, whereas EPS is standard for XOM and CVX.

### Oilfield Services (OFS)
*Sensitivity for OFS is non-linear and lagged. A sudden $10 war spike does not immediately re-price existing service contracts.*

| Ticker | Company | Sensitivity Profile |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HAL** | Halliburton | **High (Lagged)**. Most sensitive to North American land activity. A sustained $10/bbl increase typically leads to a **10-15% revision** in forward EPS estimates over a 6-month horizon as rig counts rise [cite: 5, 6]. |
| **SLB** | Schlumberger | **Moderate (Lagged)**. International focus with multi-year contracts. EBITDA margins are stickier. EPS sensitivity is driven by activity volume rather than direct commodity price pass-through [cite: 7]. |
| **BKR** | Baker Hughes | **Low-Moderate**. Significant revenue comes from Industrial & Energy Technology (IET/LNG) which is decoupled from short-term oil movements. OFSE segment (60% rev) remains sensitive [cite: 8, 9]. |
| **FTI** | TechnipFMC | **Low**. Driven by long-cycle subsea backlogs ($16.6B backlog). Pricing is locked in at project sanctioning; spot oil spikes do not impact current quarterly EPS materially [cite: 10, 11]. |

### Midstream
*Sensitivity is virtually zero regarding price; risk lies in volume.*

| Ticker | Company | Approx. Impact per $10/bbl | Source Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **KMI** | Kinder Morgan | **Negligible (~$0.01)** | Guidance states a $1/bbl change impacts EBITDA by only **$7 million** [cite: 2]. On $8.7B EBITDA, a $10 spike ($70M impact) is immaterial to EPS. |
| **EPD** | Enterprise Products | **Negligible** | "Not directly impacted by significant changes in oil prices" due to fee-based model [cite: 12]. |
| **ET** | Energy Transfer | **Negligible** | >90% fee-based margins. Sensitivity is tied to NGL fractionation spreads rather than crude oil [cite: 13, 14]. |

## 4. Revenue & Earnings Mix: Understanding the Sensitivity Drivers

This section explains *why* the sensitivities differ, based on the composition of each company's revenue streams.

### Integrated Majors (XOM, CVX)
*   **Structure:** Vertically integrated. They drill for oil (Upstream) but also refine it into gasoline/chemicals (Downstream).
*   **The Hedge Effect:** When oil prices spike, Upstream profits soar. However, refining margins often compress because crude oil (feedstock) costs rise faster than gasoline prices can be passed to consumers. This "natural hedge" lowers their overall corporate EPS beta compared to pure-play E&Ps.
*   **Split:**
    *   **XOM:** ~70% Upstream / ~30% Downstream & Chemical [cite: 1].
    *   **CVX:** ~75% Upstream / ~25% Downstream.

### Independent E&P (COP)
*   **Structure:** Pure-play Exploration and Production. No refining arm to act as a buffer.
*   **Sensitivity:** **Highest.** 100% of revenue is derived from the sale of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Revenue is directly tied to realized commodity prices.
*   **Mix:** COP has a heavy weighting toward crude oil relative to natural gas compared to peers, amplifying its sensitivity to Brent/WTI spikes [cite: 4].

### Oilfield Services (HAL, SLB, BKR, FTI)
*   **HAL:** North American (NAM) Short-Cycle. Highly exposed to US shale activity. If WTI spikes, US private drillers add rigs quickly, benefitting HAL first.
*   **SLB:** International Long-Cycle. Dominant in offshore and Middle East. Contracts are multi-year. Earnings are driven by *volume of work* (drilling activity), not the price of the commodity itself.
*   **BKR:** Balanced/Industrial. Significant revenue from **Industrial & Energy Technology (IET)**, specifically LNG turbines and compression. This segment behaves more like an industrial manufacturer with long lead times, diluting oil price sensitivity [cite: 34].
*   **FTI:** Subsea/Offshore. Revenue is driven by backlog execution ($16.6B). New orders take 12-24 months to turn into revenue. An oil spike today triggers Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for projects that generate revenue in 2026-2027 [cite: 10].

### Midstream (KMI, EPD, ET)
*   **Structure:** Fee-based "Toll Roads."
*   **Mechanism:** They charge a fee per barrel transported. They do not own the oil.
*   **Mix:**
    *   **KMI:** Heavily weighted toward **Natural Gas** transport (40% of US gas volume). More sensitive to winter weather/power demand than oil wars [cite: 35].
    *   **EPD/ET:** NGLs (Natural Gas Liquids) and Crude export volumes. Their "sensitivity" often comes from **spreads** (marketing margins) rather than flat price, but >85-90% of margin is fee-based [cite: 14].

## 5. Historical Validation: The 2022 Oil Spike Case Study
*Analyzing performance during the Russia-Ukraine invasion (Brent >$120).*

The 2022 period provides a perfect empirical test of the theoretical sensitivities.

**E&P Performance (The Direct Beneficiaries):**
*   **XOM & CVX:** Both posted record profits in 2022. XOM earnings grew ~160% year-over-year. The "hedging" effect of refining was less pronounced because refining margins *also* exploded due to global capacity shortages, creating a "double lift" scenario that may not repeat in a future war [cite: 36].
*   **COP:** Net income nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022 ($8B to $18.7B), validating its high-beta status [cite: 37].

**OFS Performance (The Lag):**
*   **HAL & SLB:** While E&Ps doubled earnings, OFS saw modest growth. SLB earnings rose ~75% (from a low base), but margins did not expand immediately. The real margin expansion for OFS occurred in late 2022/2023 as contracts were repriced [cite: 38].
*   **BKR:** Actually posted a *loss* in parts of 2022 due to restructuring and Russia exit costs, proving that idiosyncratic risks can override oil price tailwinds [cite: 38].

**Midstream Performance (The Stability):**
*   **KMI:** EPS grew only ~14% in 2022, despite oil prices doubling. This validates the low sensitivity thesis. Investors used KMI as a yield shelter, not a capital appreciation vehicle [cite: 39].
*   **ET/EPD:** Adjusted EBITDA was roughly flat to up single digits. The stock price appreciation in 2022 was driven by *valuation multiple expansion* (flight to safety) rather than earnings explosion [cite: 40].

## 6. Strategic Analysis for Trade Cards

### Midstream Specifics: Volume > Price
For KMI, EPD, and ET, the trade card risk/reward should **not** focus on Brent price targets (e.g., "$100 oil"). Instead, focus on **Volume Risks**:
*   **Bull Case:** War disrupts Middle East supply -> US Crude/LNG exports surge to Europe/Asia -> Midstream utilization hits 100% -> Tariff premiums rise.
*   **Bear Case:** Global recession triggered by high oil prices -> Demand destruction -> Throughput volumes drop -> Midstream fees decline (as contracts expire or minimum volume commitments are met).

### OFS Specifics: The "Lag" and Rig Counts
For HAL, SLB, BKR, and FTI, the trade cards must reflect the **6-month delay**:
*   **Mechanism:** An oil spike to $120 tomorrow does not change HAL's earnings Q1. It creates "Capital Discipline" friction. E&Ps are slower to drill now than in 2014.
*   **Key Metrics:** Watch **Rig Counts** and **FID (Final Investment Decision)** announcements.
    *   *Trade Idea:* Long OFS is a trade on *duration* of the conflict. If the war is short, E&Ps won't increase capex, and OFS gains nothing. If the war is structural (long-term supply loss), OFS enters a multi-year supercycle.

### Open Questions & Areas for Further Investigation
1.  **Strait of Hormuz Closure Scenarios:** While we know price sensitivity, what is the *volume* sensitivity for **ET** and **EPD** if US exports are physically bottlenecked or if global tanker insurance rates make transport prohibitive?
2.  **Refining Hedge Durability:** In 2022, refining margins spiked alongside oil. In a 2025/26 conflict, would global refining capacity (which has increased) dampen the downstream "super-profit" cycle for **XOM/CVX**?
3.  **BKR's Data Center Pivot:** How much of BKR's "Industrial" growth is tied to AI/Data Center power demand vs. traditional LNG? This non-oil correlation is growing and needs precise quantification for the risk model.
