# Summary: Energy Stock EPS Sensitivity to Oil Prices

## Abstract

Detailed analysis of ten major energy stocks reveals three distinct tiers of EPS sensitivity to oil price changes. High-sensitivity E&P/integrated majors (XOM ~$0.75-1.50/share per $10/bbl, CVX ~$1.00-2.75/share, COP ~$2.00-3.00/share) benefit immediately from oil spikes, with COP as the purest upstream play and XOM/CVX partially hedged by downstream operations. Moderate/lagged oilfield services (HAL, SLB) see EPS respond 6-12 months after oil price changes via rig count increases, with HAL's earnings roughly doubling when oil doubles. Low-sensitivity midstream names (KMI, EPD, ET) have negligible price sensitivity (~$0.01 EPS per $10/bbl for KMI) as fee-based "toll roads," but face volume risk in a Hormuz closure scenario. The 2022 Russia-Ukraine oil spike ($120+ Brent) validated these sensitivities: XOM EPS surged 146% to $13.26, COP doubled to $13.52, while KMI grew only 14%. Critically, integrated majors outperformed linear models in 2022 because refining margins also spiked -- a "double lift" that may not repeat if global refining capacity has expanded. For trade card calibration, COP is best measured by cash flow per share (CFPS) rather than EPS due to high DD&A, and OFS names are trades on conflict duration (short war = no capex increase = no OFS benefit).

## Key Insights

- **EPS Sensitivity Tiers**: E&P/Integrated: XOM ~$0.75-1.50, CVX ~$1.00-2.75, COP ~$2.00-3.00 per $10/bbl. OFS (lagged 6-12 months): HAL ~15-20% forward EPS revision, SLB ~$0.20-0.30, BKR ~$0.10-0.15. Midstream (negligible): KMI ~$0.01, EPD/ET ~$0.00.

- **COP Is the Highest-Beta Pure Upstream Play**: 100% upstream revenue, no refining hedge, no hedging strategy. EPS jumped from $6.01 (2021) to $13.52 (2022) -- $2.50 EPS per $10/bbl. Cash flow sensitivity is ~3x higher than EPS sensitivity due to DD&A structure. Best measured by CFPS for risk/reward charts. [Source: ConocoPhillips 4Q25 sensitivity data, macrotrends.net]

- **XOM/CVX Have a "Natural Hedge" That Can Become a "Double Lift"**: When oil spikes, upstream profits soar but refining margins often compress (feedstock cost inflation). This dampens overall EPS beta vs pure E&Ps. Exception: 2022 saw refining margins also explode (global capacity shortage), creating a "double lift." XOM earned $13.26 EPS vs ~$9-10 analyst expectations. Whether the double lift repeats depends on global refining capacity. [Source: ExxonMobil 2022 annual report, corporate.exxonmobil.com]

- **OFS Earnings Lag Oil by 6-12 Months**: HAL's 2022 EPS was only $1.73 (modest vs 2021's $1.63) because activity was still ramping. By 2023, EPS hit $2.92 (+69%) as rig counts responded. SLB showed a similar pattern: $2.20 in 2022, $3.00+ in 2023. OFS is a trade on conflict duration -- short war means no E&P capex increase, no OFS benefit.

- **BKR Is Structurally Different from HAL/SLB**: ~45% of revenue from Industrial & Energy Technology (LNG turbines, data center power). Oil price sensitivity is muted. BKR's Q1 2025 net income rose 19% YoY despite flat oil, driven by IET segment. The open question is how much future growth comes from LNG/low-carbon tech vs traditional OFS.

- **TechnipFMC Is a Late-Cycle Winner**: $16.6B subsea backlog driven by post-2022 FIDs. Oil spike today triggers project sanctions that generate FTI revenue in 2027-2028. Most lagged sensitivity of any name analyzed. Record backlog and improving margins confirm the offshore upcycle thesis. [Source: TechnipFMC Q4 2025 results, marketbeat.com]

- **Midstream EPS Is Volume-Sensitive, Not Price-Sensitive**: KMI EBITDA moves only $7M per $1/bbl change. EPD and ET are >85-90% fee-based. The war trade for midstream is about U.S. export volumes replacing lost Middle East supply, not oil price realization. Bull case: US LNG/crude exports surge to replace Gulf supply, utilization hits 100%. Bear case: global recession from $150 oil crushes demand and throughput.

- **Consensus EPS Estimates (FY2025/2026)**: XOM $6.92/$7.06, CVX $10.44/$11.50, COP $6.16/$7.16, SLB $3.38/$3.58, HAL $2.26/$2.68, BKR $2.66/$3.06, KMI $1.37/$1.50, EPD $3.06/$3.23, ET $1.60/$1.73. All assume ~$65-70/bbl oil; war scenario at $100-150/bbl would require significant upward revisions for E&P names. [Source: TipRanks, MarketBeat, StockAnalysis]

- **2022 Validation Summary**: E&Ps outperformed expectations (XOM +146%, COP +125% EPS growth). OFS lagged in 2022 but surged in 2023 (HAL +69%). Midstream barely moved (KMI +14% EPS). BKR posted a loss despite high oil due to Russia exit costs -- proving idiosyncratic risks can override oil tailwinds. [Source: Historical earnings data, macrotrends.net]

## Open Questions

### If global refining capacity has expanded since 2022, will the XOM/CVX "double lift" from concurrent refining margin spikes repeat in a 2026 war scenario?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
Mixed outlook. Global capacity growth decelerating to ~620 kb/d/year (slowest pace in 30 years). European closures (~495 kb/d) create structural tightness. If Middle Eastern refineries are disrupted, double lift repeats. If only crude is affected (harassment scenario), upstream lift only. Asia-Pacific additions provide more buffer than 2022. Conservative case: model upstream only; upside case: add $1-2/share for refining margin expansion. See [details](./QUICK_refining_capacity_double_lift.md).

### How much of BKR's future earnings growth is tied to AI data center power demand vs traditional oilfield activity?
**Status:** Resolved (quick research)
IET segment (~45% of revenue) is the primary growth driver, with record $14.9B orders and $32.4B RPO. Data center orders targeting $3B by 2027 (currently <10% of revenue but fastest-growing). OFSE (~55%) is oil-price-sensitive with 6-12 month lag. IET margins hit 20% (record). BKR is lower-beta to oil than HAL/SLB due to structural IET growth. See [details](./QUICK_bkr_data_center_revenue.md).

### What is the volume sensitivity for ET and EPD if US exports are physically bottlenecked or global tanker insurance rates make transport prohibitive during a Hormuz closure?
**Status:** Filtered
Already substantially covered in Key Insights of this summary ("Midstream EPS Is Volume-Sensitive, Not Price-Sensitive" section) and in deepresearch-energy-oil war risk insurance research. Bull case: US exports surge to replace Gulf supply. Bear case: recession crushes demand.
