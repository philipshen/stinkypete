# Quick Research: Baker Hughes AI Data Center Power Revenue Mix

## Question
How much of BKR's future earnings growth is tied to AI data center power demand vs traditional oilfield activity?

## Key Findings

### Current Revenue/Earnings Split
- **Full-year 2025 revenue:** $27.7B (flat YoY)
- **IET segment (Industrial & Energy Technology):** ~45% of revenue, growing faster
- **OFSE segment (Oilfield Services & Equipment):** ~55% of revenue, declining/flat
- **IET Q4 2025 EBITDA margin:** 20% (record, up 160 bps YoY)
- **Full-year IET orders:** $14.9B (record), with IET RPO of $32.4B

### Data Center Specific Exposure
- **$3 billion data center order target** by 2027 (management guidance)
- Current data center orders are a small but rapidly growing portion of IET
- BKR provides gas turbines and power generation equipment for on-site/behind-the-meter data center power
- Strategy pivot: "gas-to-LNG" narrative shifting to "gas-to-power" for hyperscale data centers
- Key products: NovaLT gas turbines, compressors, and power management systems for co-located gas plants

### 2026 Growth Outlook
- **IET margins:** Expected to sustain 20% in 2026
- **Total company margins:** Targeting ~18% in 2026, path to 20% by 2028
- **Mid-single-digit organic Adjusted EBITDA growth** expected in 2026
- IET is the primary growth driver; OFSE is the oil-price-sensitive laggard

### Earnings Sensitivity Decomposition
- **Traditional OFS (via OFSE segment):** ~55% of revenue, directly tied to oil prices and rig counts with 6-12 month lag
- **LNG equipment (via IET):** ~25-30% of revenue, driven by long-cycle LNG project FIDs (3-5 year backlog visibility)
- **Data center/gas-to-power (via IET):** Currently <10% of revenue but targeting significant growth
- **Other industrial (via IET):** ~10-15%, including downstream chemicals, refining equipment

### Implication for Trade Cards
BKR is NOT a pure oil play. The IET segment provides structural earnings growth independent of oil prices, making BKR lower-beta to oil than HAL or SLB. For the trade card:
- **Oil sensitivity:** Lower than peers (~$0.10-0.15 EPS per $10/bbl, lagged 6-12 months via OFSE)
- **Structural growth:** Data center + LNG provides earnings floor even if oil declines
- **War scenario:** BKR benefits from (1) LNG security demand (replacement for Middle East gas), (2) eventual OFS activity increase if conflict is protracted, but (3) OFSE Middle East operations could be disrupted
- **Conviction:** MEDIUM -- less direct war beneficiary than HAL, but more defensible earnings profile
