# Research Configuration
# Edit these settings to control how research sessions behave.
# Agents read this file but never modify it.

# Which deep research API to use.
#   "gemini"  - Google Gemini Deep Research API only
#   "openai"  - OpenAI Deep Research API only
#   "random"  - Randomly pick gemini or openai for each topic
#   "all"     - Run both APIs per topic (doubles cost, cross-validates)
deep_research_api: "all"

# Maximum number of deep-research subagents running concurrently.
# Higher = faster but more API calls and costs.
max_parallel_agents: 3

# When the TODO reaches this count, the orchestrator pauses and asks
# whether to continue, narrow scope, or synthesize with what's available.
# Set to 0 for no limit.
